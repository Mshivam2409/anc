                            <h2> Getting the Internship</h2>
                            <br />
                            Since my early days at IITK, I have been interested in research in pure mathematics. Thanks
                            to a project I did with Prof. Mohua Banerjee, during my second year summers, I got
                            especially interested in mathematical logic. Hence, I chose to pursue research in
                            mathematical logic for my internship. Although I applied to almost all the intern programs
                            with opportunities in logic, I could not get an internship through any programs.
                            <br />
                            Instead, I got the internship through Prof. Banerjee. I remember that when Prof. Banerjee
                            had agreed to help me get an internship, she had asked if I’d be satisfied with an
                            internship in India and I had agreed. However, about a week after she asked me, I received
                            an email from Prof. Alessandra Palmigiano from Delft University.
                            <br />
                            <img src="i3.png" class="blog-img" style="float:left" /><br />
                            Alessandra mentioned that she was contacted by Prof. Banerjee. She offered me not only an
                            internship at Delft University in the Netherlands but also allowed me to stay at her place
                            in Amsterdam. This effectively reduced my trip’s cost to the flight tickets, which I hoped
                            that KVPY scholarship would cover. In any case, I decided that I should take the
                            opportunity, since Alessandra’s groups worked on algebraic proof theory which was in line
                            with my interests.
                            <br />
                            Both Mohua and Alessandra helped me through all the logistics and I managed to reach
                            Amsterdam without any hiccups.

                          

                            <br /><br /><br />

                            <h2>My Internship Experience</h2>
                            <br />
                            I was received at the Amsterdam airport by Prof. Alessandra and her PhD student Fei Liang, a
                            short thin Chinese guy. Alessandra drove us to her place and after considerable collective
                            struggles we managed to get my bags up a typical narrow Dutch staircase and I was shown my
                            room.
                            <br />
                            Fei lived in the adjacent room and we had a big study room which we used for all the work.
                            Alessandra also introduced me to her husband Prof. Nachoem Wajnberg, a professor of Business
                            Science at the Amsterdam University. We had many discussions with Nachoem on applications of
                            our work to business sciences.
                            <br />
                            Alessandra believes that rather than spending a lot of initial time on learning theory, one
                            must jump into research itself. She told me that you can understand things much better if
                            you actually study them for your research work.
                            <br />
                            Alessandra’s home was the best possible environment for the research. We had a comfortable
                            office for a lot of people, many people with different expertise to help and a lot of
                            enthusiastic discussions on logic in general.
                            <br />
                            <img src="i1.png" class="blog-img" style="float:right" /><br />
                            I soon realised that collaboration is an essential part of modern research and cohesive
                            research groups are much more efficient than individuals. I worked with Fei and Apostolos, 2
                            PhD students of Alessandra and Dr. Guiseppe Greco, a postdoc at Ultrecht University. I also
                            soon realised that writing research papers is a very tedious job as apart from your results,
                            you need to put a lot of effort in language, presentation and references to make your work
                            publishable. The members of the household helped me a lot in not only, actual research work
                            but also, other technical stuff involved.
                            <br />
                            During my stay, we were visited by Prof. Hiroakira Ono from Japan for around 2 weeks. Prof.
                            Ono is one of the pioneers in algebraic proof theory and I had the pleasure of meeting him.
                            <br />
                            Attend Fei and Apostolos’s PhD defence ceremony was another memorable experience. Dutch
                            universities ask students to arrange international conferences at the convocation ceremony.
                            We had a conference on logic for social behaviour at Delft University. I met many
                            researchers in different fields related to logic during this conference from all across the
                            world. Some of them even lived at Alessandra’s place for some days. I also presented my
                            earlier work on rough algebras at the conference. It was a unique experience to witness
                            Dutch convocations.
                            <br />
                            After convocation, I had little time left and it was the most hectic, yet productive part of
                            the internship. We wanted to get as much work done as possible before I leave. I took a few
                            days off in the last week to get a much needed break. By the end we managed to almost finish
                            the first draft of rough concepts paper (which was of course changed many more times before
                            submission). We have managed to publish 3 papers after a long period of corrections,
                            submissions, revisions, etc.
                            <br />
                            <h2>  <br />Living in Amsterdam</h2><br />
                          
                            Apart from my professional indulgences, I attended convocation parties and treats, met new
                            people, walked in parks, watched FIFA matches at pubs, and went touring the beautiful
                            streets and canals of Amsterdam and a number of places across the Netherlands. I was also
                            visited by my sister and some IITK friends. To my delight, we lived very close to Van Gogh
                            museum, which is probably the most famous tourist spot in Amsterdam.

                            <br />

                            <img src="i2.png" class="blog-img" style="float:left" />
                            Fei who had also come out of China for the first time and being an Asian, had a lifestyle
                            similar to mine, became my best friend in Amsterdam.
                            <br />
                            As I left, we had to make considerably less effort to get my luggage down the same
                            staircase, as all the food in it was finished. Alessandra dropped me at the airport in her
                            car again while inviting me to work with her again.
                            <br />
                            We still work together on research projects. I joined Alessandra and her group at a research
                            workshop in South Africa in 2019 and more recently in the Netherlands for a workshop at the
                            Lorentz Centre, Leieden. Alessandra’s group is one of the most vibrant and hard working
                            groups in the field and I feel grateful to have worked with her.
                            <br />
