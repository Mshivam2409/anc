                <p>
                  Hello guys and gals! I am Raghav Garg pursuing a Computer
                  Science major and I went to Samsung South Korea for my summer
                  internship in 2019 and worked with the AI R&D team under
                  Mobile Division in Suwon. Through this post I try to give you
                  a better insight of not only how life is inside Samsung Korea
                  but how South Korea is in general.<br /><br />

                  <strong>How to Get into Samsung Korea?</strong><br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  I got into Samsung Korea through the SPO Internship Programme
                  and as far as I am aware this is the only way to get there
                  apart from working at Samsung Bangalore which probably gets
                  you a training programme in Samsung Korea.<br />
                  Samsung Korea shortlists students on the basis of CPI and JEE
                  rank. Usually the ones with CPI > 9.5 or top JEE rankers in
                  CSE and EE get selected unless you have done exceptional in
                  Olympiads.<br />
                  The shortlisted students then have to give a 3-hour coding
                  test which is not very difficult and brute force solutions to
                  recursive problems are also generally accepted.<br />
                  The HR guys basically check if you are willing to try to adapt
                  to a new environment and whether you can manage minor
                  hiccups/problems in language and food. The technical round is
                  also not very exhaustive and you could clear it easily with
                  good data structures knowledge. The final shortlist is biased
                  a little towards high CPI and JEE rank but they do give a
                  decent weightage to your interviews.<br /><br />

                  <strong>How was Korea?</strong><br /><br />
                  Korea is one of the few countries where you could gain a lot
                  in terms of experience. People are unusually quite unlike
                  Indians and often prefer to roam as couples or alone. They are
                  slightly shy and would try to avoid conversations if their
                  English is weak but all of them are very supportive. The
                  geography allows you to actually visit a lot of places in your
                  short internship period as the country is almost the size of
                  Delhi NCR. The weather was awesome throughout my internship
                  period and served as a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />

                  <strong>Any issues with Food or LanguageðŸ˜£?</strong
                  ><br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  This is one of the major questions that trouble most people
                  going abroad and especially if you are going to an Asian
                  country like South Korea. Well then there is some good news
                  for you guys.<br />
                  If you are a non-vegetarian then there is no problem at all.
                  There are a lot of delicacies to taste ranging from fish to
                  pork and much more. Even if you are a vegetarian like me,
                  there is nothing to fear. Samsungâ€™s office in Suwon offers
                  vegetarian meals 3 times a day and the residence of the
                  employees is especially built by Samsung for Indians and
                  Bangladeshis and offers good Indian meals three times a day. I
                  had the best breakfast of my life there. Apart from that,
                  there are pizza shops inside the office and you would end up
                  eating there most often. So I would just say you would
                  absolutely have no worries regarding food if you are going to
                  Suwon.
                  <br />
                  Now letâ€™s talk about Language. People talk in Korean there.
                  People are taught English but they are not very confident in
                  conversing in English as they donâ€™t have a lot of experience
                  and so would most try to avoid conversations. But most people
                  you would have to talk to in office would be pretty good in
                  English and you will face no problem. You might have to make
                  extra effort in talking to locals. You will often end up using
                  Google Translate.

                  <br /><br />

                  <strong>How was the work like?</strong><br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Samsung is one of the very few companies that give you the
                  freedom to choose your field of work. Whether you like IoT,
                  AI/ML, networks, cloud, Big Data or anything else, there is a
                  team which works on it. You are asked to submit a preference
                  list of your field of work and then they assign you the team
                  based on your preferences and your resume. Most people end up
                  getting one of their top two choices and are happy with it.<br />
                  The work culture there is pretty flexible and they allow you
                  to choose your own projects (after discussions with your
                  mentor). It basically means the work is not just about
                  applying your pre-occupied knowledge but you can start working
                  on completely new topic by learning it from scratch.<br />
                  They donâ€™t usually expect groundbreaking work from interns but
                  they just want to check your technical knowledge and your will
                  to learn. Their main focus of the internship is to identify
                  good people who are able to adapt to their teams and would
                  love to work here so that they can give them Pre-Placement
                  Offers. This is so because projects of most people (NOT ALL!)
                  are not about deploying it on Samsung Platforms but to test
                  our technical knowledge.
                  <br /><br />

                  <strong>Nostalgia</strong><br /><br />

                  Overall it was a very nice experience with both intellectual
                  and monetary (LOL) benefits. You get to meet a lot of new
                  people and I still miss those coffee sessions and TT rounds
                  that we use to have all day around when we were not
                  working.<br /><br />
                  Cheers!!!
