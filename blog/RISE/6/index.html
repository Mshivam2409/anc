                <p class="blog-intro">
                  In the sixth article of the blog series - RISE, Agrim Bari an
                  undergraduate student in the ​ Department of Electrical
                  Engineering from the Y15 batch brings to light, the
                  "horrifying" process of seeking a foreign internship in an
                  interesting manner. He did his summer internship from the New
                  York University. This blog is a one stop solution for anyone
                  wandering around seeking advice regarding a foreign research
                  intern.<br /><br />

                  <em
                    >New York University (NYU) is a private research university
                    originally founded in New York City but now has campuses and
                    locations throughout the world. As of March 2019, 37 Nobel
                    Laureates, 8 Turing Award winners, 5 Fields Medalists, over
                    30 Academy Award winners, over 30 Pulitzer Prize winners,
                    and hundreds of members of the National Academies of
                    Sciences and United States Congress have been affiliated as
                    faculty or alumni.</em

                  What's the best way to decide whether you should or shouldn't
                  go for a foreign internship? If you should, then how would you
                  ensure that you get to see the sun on foreign soil? Wait,
                  there are stipulations/prerequisites for this as well?<br /><br />
                  Unfortunately, yes! But what are these requirements: CPI?
                  Statement of Purpose? Cover letter? Luck? Letter(s) of
                  Recommendation (My mom and dad could write me one, would that
                  suffice?)<br /><br />
                  In the paragraphs to follow I will try to paint a picture, a
                  picture based on personal experiences, one that might help you
                  in your decision process. So, let's dive in (Wait, I don't
                  know swimming :P). <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  <strong>
                    'Udne ke liye bas pankh chahiye, udna toh seekh hi lenge' </strong
                  >:<br />
                  Right from the commencement of your third year or for some,
                  the second year , the prospect of foreign internships would
                  kindle your minds. The seeds for the same, to be sown right
                  should be done by taking help of individuals who posted
                  pictures of themselves while interning abroad (But I don't use
                  Facebook? Huh, interesting). I began with the same late in
                  June itself so as to keep my horses ready when the time comes
                  (No, I wasn't getting ready for a fight). I got in touch with
                  seniors and enquired about their experiences. This, in turn,
                  gave me an ample of closure on whether this will suit me or
                  not. <br /><br />
                  <strong> 'Jaan-pehchan ke baad kya karna hai?' </strong
                  >:<br />
                  Thereby I began spending time on the OIR (Office of
                  International Relations) website exploring the various
                  possible opportunities as well as making a timeline of the
                  deadlines of various academic interns. Though there are many
                  other ways to exact this, I found this method best suited to
                  me since the website was the only authentic source under the
                  name tag of IITK. Next on the list is your eligibility
                  criterion, duly make note of this before making way for it. In
                  case you aren't sure about what a specific line means, you
                  should mail those handling the application process in due
                  time. Also, if you are confused about a particular document,
                  it's best to probe the application handlers. Once you are
                  clear about the same, you can begin with your application
                  process. <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"

                  />

                  <strong>'Itna bada kyun hai application?’</strong>:
                  <br />Truth be told, you will have to prepare a lot of things
                  for your application. The following are always asked for:
                  Cover letter, Statement of Purpose/Motivation letter,
                  Recommendation, Resume/CV. Let's kill the ducks one by one.
                  First up is your cover letter; this letter introduces you,
                  highlights your purpose for writing, underlines a few of your
                  experiences or skills and appeals for a response. Next up, the
                  Statement of Purpose or Motivation letter; this provides you
                  with the opportunity to address your academic, personal, and
                  professional goals as well as your aspirations. It should
                  reference relevant examples from your background and throw
                  light on your character and accomplishments. Following this,
                  vivid accounts of your behaviour and personal qualities told
                  by others, play an indispensable role in their evaluation of
                  your application; these would be your letter(s) of
                  recommendation. Your letter(s) of recommendation should
                  provide specific examples and anecdotes that illustrate your
                  ability and desire to make a difference in the world. Finally,
                  your Resume should highlight your skills, education and
                  experiences in brief. Also, don't forget to add subtle
                  creative flair to make it stand out. The time spent on these
                  only come to fruition if done aptly with due diligence. Does
                  it end here? No, you have to now get it reviewed by seniors so
                  as to get it patched up (In some cases maybe everywhere, yes
                  it happened with me). Don't forget to do this necessary evil.
                  Your things might look perfect to you but essentially, what
                  matters is others' perspectives (Here too?). <br /><br />

                  Post all this, begins the long wait, almost as long as the
                  wait for the next season of your favourite T.V. show. In the
                  meanwhile, I would say, don’t be relying on just one
                  application, rather try your luck at various destinations.
                  Besides this, always keep a backup plan, it could be a company
                  internship, an on-campus intern etc. Appending the same, I
                  will now detail my foreign internship experience. The views
                  are personal and shouldn't be trusted blindly. <br /><br />

                  The level of knowledge accumulated with all the vivid
                  experiences of how to present oneself in a more lucid way, was
                  unparalleled. One that I got to know for the first time while
                  working at NYU. That memory is still very clear in my mind,
                  the proceedings of our first meeting there. Our mentor asked
                  the three of us what our hobbies were and then also told us
                  how we could enjoy there more. It really helped us relish our
                  transitory stay in the New York city. I really liked the idea
                  of weekly presentations to keep track of our progress, and the
                  advice often given in such presentations. Above all, I enjoyed
                  the company of a couple of really motivated and passionate
                  people working under him who were as welcoming to help us as
                  he was. Besides this, I also delved into the buildings of the
                  following, though not restricted to this list: cultural
                  awareness, adaptability, improving the communication skills
                  and finally connecting internationally.<br /><br />
                  <strong>
                    "Fulfilling work doesn't come from the path of least
                    resistance.":
                  </strong>
                  <br />Finally trying to answer the last of all the questions
                  on whether you should really try it or not. Actually, there is
                  no great mystery behind all this. If we want to do something
                  worthwhile, that is also a vocation, we should not passively
                  wait around for it to appear out of thin air. Instead, we
                  should take action and endeavour to grow it. How? Simply by
                  devoting ourselves to work that gives us deep fulfilment
                  through meaning, flow and freedom. … Over time, a tangible and
                  inspiring goal may quietly germinate, proliferate, and
                  eventually flower into life. Who knows maybe this could be
                  your calling and it sure would be worth the experience because
                  after all, <br /><strong>'Zindagi na milege dobara!'</strong>.
