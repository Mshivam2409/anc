                  <strong>Getting Interested in Research:</strong>
                  <br /><br />After completing my fourth semester, I was in a
                  dilemma as to what my interests actually were. Was there
                  something I was good at or whether I should prepare for the
                  coming internship season or look for an academic internship.
                  Well, before all this, I had to figure out how to make my 2nd
                  year summers more productive. I was lucky enough to get
                  selected for the SURGE program and this served as one of the
                  stages where I did not learn much in economics, but did get
                  help sorting my preference of whether to sit for the coming
                  internship season or not. My professor was not on campus for a
                  large part of the summers, but in the limited interactions I
                  had with him, he gave me the confidence that exploring
                  research areas in economics is pretty much worth it. Besides,
                  my parents also didn’t want me working for some private
                  company, no matter how much they offer in terms of monetary
                  assets. These two things significantly helped me take a
                  decision of giving the SPO intern season a pass and putting in
                  my best possible efforts to get a foreign research internship.
                  Honestly speaking, more than interest in Economics, it was the
                  motivation to visit a foreign country that kept me striving
                  for an academic research internship.<br /><br />
                  <strong>Applying for Foreign Internship</strong><br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  After making my preferences clear about foreign internships, I
                  started browsing the countries where it was possible to get an
                  internship along with a stipend. The easier thing to do was to
                  apply at places where seniors had already gone but being in
                  Economics, this set was very small. The first place that I
                  targeted was Germany, simply because few of my seniors from
                  our previous batches had been there. DAAD - a famous
                  scholarship program for Germany had it’s deadline in October.
                  The program requires you to contact a professor in Germany who
                  is ready to supervise you and DAAD sponsors your visit to
                  Germany (<a href="https://www.daad.de/en/"
                    >https://www.daad.de/en/</a
                  >). Getting a professor to supervise and applying for DAAD
                  scholarship before the deadline was an uphill task. I started
                  mailing professors in Germany mid-August onwards and mailed
                  around 100+ professors in a span of a month. Out of more than
                  100 mails sent, I received responses for only 10-15, those too
                  negative. Well with 10 days left for the deadline, a professor
                  finally agreed. Though the university wasn’t that good, I
                  accepted the opportunity with both hands as I thought that was
                  the only chance for me to travel abroad. I had a skype
                  interview with the professor where she inquired about my
                  expectations from the visit and my areas of interest. I had
                  seen her profile and a few papers, and answered all questions
                  aligning with her area of research. I applied for DAAD
                  scholarship and waited for results till January.<br /><br />
                  Simultaneously, at the end of August, applications opened up
                  for the program called MITACS CANADA. Under this program, a
                  series of projects are floated (around 4000) covering almost
                  every field ranging from engineering to social sciences.
                  Students are required to fill choices of seven projects in at
                  least three different provinces of Canada. The deadline of the
                  program is around the end of September (usually during the mid
                  semester exams). If you are really keen on applying for this
                  program, I strongly recommend that you complete the procedure
                  a week before the deadline because it becomes really difficult
                  to manage the application procedure during your mid-terms.
                  Coming to my application, I applied for the program and
                  awaited the results. The results were to be declared in two
                  rounds - December and January. Meanwhile, shifting my focus
                  from Germany, I started applying in other universities across
                  the globe like US, UK, France, Australia, etc. I prepared a
                  list of universities and then browsed the faculty profiles
                  whose areas of interest fascinated me. For writing mails, it
                  is usually a good practice to mention the published article on
                  which the professor has worked and communicate properly as to
                  how your interests align with his/her interests. I started
                  making a list of such professors a bit late in the semester.
                  For a smooth academic research internship application, I would
                  recommend you to devote some time to this during the summers
                  itself.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  While I sent hundreds of mails, I did not receive a single
                  positive response. Well, it was frustrating and to some extent
                  expected as well. To be on the safer side, I started applying
                  in India as well in universities like DSE, IIMs, etc. However,
                  the fortune did not see a turn around there as well. The
                  period from October till December kept me pondering if it was
                  a wrong decision for me to not sit for the SPO internship
                  season and I started panicking. There are other programs as
                  well (not for the Economics department) - TAMU, NYU, NTU,
                  VITERBI. A list of such programs is available on International
                  Relations Website. However, there still was a ray of hope as
                  the results for the two programs were yet to be announced in
                  January '18. The New year did not start on a good note at all
                  - a rejection on the most awaited DAAD scholarship shattered
                  my hopes completely. It was the only program where a senior
                  from our department was accepted the previous year. A
                  rejection here meant that mailing was the only way left to get
                  the internship. On Jan 14, when the DAAD results were
                  declared, I sent more than 20 mails that night - rejection
                  instilled a motivation to try even harder. Well, the effort
                  was in vain because, firstly I never received a single reply
                  to these mails and secondly, the next morning I woke up to see
                  a mail from MITACS that I was accepted for the 3 month
                  internship in University of Victoria, Canada. <br /><br />
                  <strong>Internship Experience:</strong><br /><br />
                  After a long journey, I finally arrived in Victoria on 05 May
                  2018, and it did take a week or two to adjust to this new
                  environment and the major problem was food. I did not know
                  much about cooking and it was not feasible to eat in
                  restaurants daily. So, in the initial few weeks, I pushed
                  myself to learn to cook. While on the other hand, my project
                  had already started. My supervisor was Dr. Rob Gillezeau who
                  was working on "Racial Uprisings and Responsiveness of
                  Government". My supervisor was on leave from the college and
                  was working for the provincial government. So I had the
                  freedom of working from home. But, while at a foreign
                  university, it is always good to make new connections,
                  interact with people from around the world and getting
                  accustomed to the work culture especially if one is planning
                  to pursue higher studies. The good thing about my internship
                  was MITACS used to organise regular get-together for students
                  from other countries who had also come through the same
                  program. During my time, there were around 6 students from
                  India, one student from Brazil, one from Ukraine and Mexico,
                  two from Tunisia and there were a few from China. These small
                  get-togethers made life easy and the internship much more
                  happening.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  On the work front, unlike my other friends, I was not supposed
                  to work in a lab and neither I had to report to my professor.
                  So, I used to meet my supervisor weekly in the cafe where we
                  used to discuss the progress of the project. This was an
                  experience on its own where there was no one watching you and
                  neither there was much pressure but it had a side effect of
                  its own, I used to get a very limited amount of time to
                  discuss things with the professor and also, no mandatory
                  attendance often made me lazy. Often when I was struck with
                  doubts, I had to wait till the next meet to get them cleared.
                  However, I believe despite these negatives, my professor was
                  very enthusiastic about my project and made himself free
                  whenever I wished for a meeting. Since I knew I would have a
                  limited number of meetings, I tried to work hard for every
                  meeting so that I could maximise the utility of every meeting.
                  When I look back, I feel like positives of not having
                  professor on campus overshadowed the negatives and also
                  provided me freedom to do research at my comfort level. The
                  inputs I used to receive were in fact exquisite. There was a
                  phase during my internship where I felt like I did not have
                  enough work to do and I conveyed the same to my professor.
                  After this, he involved me in another project which was of
                  similar nature and I was happy to contribute to the same. For
                  those of you who would be going for a research internship, I
                  believe it is important to convey whatever you feel to the
                  professor, as they are always ready to provide you with any
                  kind of help and even go out of way to get your problems
                  solved.<br /><br />
                  Besides the research, everyone there took off during the
                  weekends and enjoyed it to fullest. Usual activities included
                  trekking, sports, sightseeing and during these, I made some
                  really close friends from different nations which made the
                  internship even more fun. The three months went by with the
                  blink of an eye. Besides, during my stay I was fortunate to be
                  a part of two conferences in Vancouver whose registration fee
                  was completely sponsored by MITACS. This gave me an
                  opportunity to interact with world renowned Mathematicians and
                  Economists and it was a real pleasure to attend their talks
                  and the free food that came with the conferences made them
                  even more exhilirating.
