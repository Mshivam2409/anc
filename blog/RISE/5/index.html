                  In the fifth article of the blog series - RISE, Devansh
                  Saraswat an undergraduate student in the Department of
                  Materials Science Engineering from the Y15 batch pens down in
                  depth information about the major components of graduate
                  application in a detailed manner along with some of his
                  enlightening tips, making it a must read for sure. <br />He

                    Cornell University is a private and statutory Ivy League
                    research university in Ithaca, New York that has been ranked

                <p>
                  One of the most stressful, time-consuming, and tedious period
                  for any Masters or Ph.D. aspirant is the university
                  application phase. Which college should I apply to? How should
                  I shortlist the universities? How many colleges should I apply
                  to? What college will I get into based on my profile? These
                  are some of the several questions faced by any final year
                  student. Through this blog, I wish to address the majority of
                  these critical questions and share my experiences of applying
                  to Mater’s programs in US universities.<br /><br />
                  Before starting with the details, I would like to introduce
                  myself in a few lines. I have completed my B. Tech in
                  Materials Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur. Now I will
                  be heading to Cornell University this Fall semester for
                  pursuing a Master's degree in MSE. <br /><br />

                  The major components of a graduate application for a US
                  university are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>GRE and TOEFL scores</li>
                  <li>Your transcript (grades till the sixth semester)</li>
                  <li>Statement of Purpose</li>
                  <li>Letters of Recommendation</li>
                  <li>Online Graduate School Application</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Now I will go into the details of these major components.<br /><br />
                  <strong>GRE and TOEFL</strong><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  Any student going to the US for graduate studies needs to
                  appear for the GRE and TOEFL irrespective of his/her
                  discipline. I will describe these two exams in short here. GRE
                  (Graduate Record Examination) General Test consists of three
                  sections: 1) Analytical Writing, 2) Verbal Reasoning, and 3)
                  Quantitative Reasoning. The analytical writing section
                  consists of two essay-based questions. This section is graded
                  out of 6. The verbal section tests your vocabulary and
                  in-depth understanding of the English language. The
                  quantitative section evaluates your mental ability and
                  consists of basic mathematics questions that any engineering
                  student can easily solve. Both these sections are worth 170
                  points each.<br /><br />
                  TOEFL is a computer-based exam for testing your English
                  skills. It has four sections: Reading, Listening, Speaking,
                  and Writing. Each section is worth 30 points each. Each
                  university sets a minimum cut off score for TOEFL. Most
                  universities have their cut-offs around 80-90, very few have
                  as high as 105 for engineering students.<br /><br />
                  I began preparing for GRE and TOEFL after I returned to IITK
                  after completing my research internship. I think a one-month
                  preparation is adequate for getting a good score. At this
                  moment, most of the readers would have this question in their
                  mind as to what is a ‘good score'. In my opinion, any score
                  above 320 out of 340 is a good score in GRE. One thing to keep
                  in mind is that GRE scores are not the only criteria for
                  selection; you are evaluated based on your GRE score, GPA,
                  SOP, and LORs. All of the above matter and having a high
                  score/evaluation in any one of these does not mean automatic/
                  guaranteed selection. So even if you have a lower score, you
                  can still get selected if you perform well on the other
                  criteria.<br /><br />
                  There are numerous online resources that you can use for
                  studying for GRE. For instance, I used the MAGOOSH GRE
                  FLASHCARDS app for improving my vocabulary, which helped me to
                  prepare for the Verbal Reasoning section. You don't need to
                  study for the quantitative reasoning section. The questions
                  are very trivial for an IIT student. After you take an
                  appointment for your GRE exam on the ETS website, you will get
                  access to two free official GRE practice tests. Additionally,
                  there are other free GRE practice tests offered by Manhattan
                  Prep, KAPLAN, etc.<br /><br />
                  I did not spend much time preparing for TOEFL. If you are
                  studying for GRE, then there is no need to study more for
                  TOEFL. The difficulty level of TOEFL is much lower than that
                  of GRE. I practiced only for the speaking and listening
                  section using some YouTube videos. No need to prepare for
                  other sections. <br /><br />
                  Some tips which I would like to share based on my experiences
                  of GRE and TOEFL:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Appear for at least 3-4 practice tests before the actual
                    GRE. If you don't perform well in these practice tests,
                    don't get disheartened. You will score about 4-5 more points
                    in the actual exam if you have studied hard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some people tend to delay taking an appointment for GRE and
                    TOEFL because they think that their vocabulary is not up to
                    the mark, and they need to study a lot more. In my opinion,
                    one-month preparation is more than enough for getting a good
                    score. Study the whole of August and appear for GRE and
                    TOEFL in the first week of September. You can schedule your
                    GRE on a Saturday and TOEFL on a Sunday. This will also save
                    a lot of your time, especially before the Mid Sem Exams.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the TOEFL exam, it can get very noisy in the
                    examination room during the speaking section. Although you
                    will be wearing headphones, you will hear a lot of noise.
                    One way to deal with this is to enter the examination room
                    at last. If you adopt this strategy, it will be much easier
                    to concentrate because by the time your speaking section
                    will start, most of the others would have moved onto their
                    writing section, and the room would be relatively quiet. I
                    adopted this strategy and benefitted from it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While taking practice tests, never skip the analytical
                    writing section. This will help you to get accustomed to
                    writing essays in a small time frame.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Selecting Universities</strong><br />
                  After appearing for GRE and TOEFL, I began shortlisting the
                  universities. First, I made a list of universities (based on
                  their rankings) along with their application deadlines. Then I
                  browsed through the websites of each of these universities to
                  learn about the research in my area of interest and looked at
                  the profiles of the professors. After this, I made a final
                  list of 12 universities out of which four were in the top 10,
                  four in 10-25 and four were in a 25-50 range of the
                  rankings.<br /><br />
                  Another important point that deters people from applying is
                  their CPI. I would say that anyone who has CPI > 7.5 should
                  apply. You can make up for your CPI by performing well on
                  other parameters such as GRE, SOP, and LORs. Having a high CPI
                  is not a guarantee of getting selected in top universities. As
                  mentioned before, your application is evaluated on a lot of
                  parameters, hence no need to panic if you don't perform well
                  on one parameter.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Another misconception which I had in my mind while applying
                  was the concept of so-called ‘safe university' where I thought
                  I would get selected based on my credentials. This
                  misconception was cleared when I got admission offers from
                  universities I did not expect and was rejected by those which
                  I considered as ‘safe'. Hence, I would advise everyone to even
                  apply to those universities which you think are beyond you and
                  don't consider any university as a definite safe option.<br /><br />
                  Most of these universities have their deadlines in late
                  November, early and mid-December and mid-January. Hence, you
                  have the entire winter break to utilize for completing your
                  application. Go through the FAQs of your graduate program. You
                  can get various other tips for a successful application at a
                  particular university by reading the FAQs.<br /><br />
                  Another deterrent for most Indian students is the lack of
                  funding. If you are applying for a Ph.D., then you will
                  certainly receive a scholarship from your university which
                  will take care of your expenses. The problem of funding is
                  faced by Masters' aspirants. Most universities don't provide
                  scholarship to the Master's students. But if you have good
                  credentials, you may receive a partial scholarship of around $
                  1000-2500 per semester. Many universities allow their master's
                  students to work as research assistants or teaching
                  assistants. The stipend you receive for these assistantships
                  is enough to take care of your tuition fees. Also, if you have
                  good credentials, then you can apply for external fellowships.
                  A list of external fellowships can be found on UCLA's website.
                  I would say that you should look at all these aspects before
                  deciding to pursue a Master's degree in the US.<br /><br />

                  <strong>Statement of Purpose</strong><br />
                  In my opinion, this is the most important component of the
                  application. There is no set pattern or way of writing an SOP.
                  It is a personal choice as to how you want to present yourself
                  in a few thousand words. Here, I am going to present a few
                  pointers which I had in my mind while writing.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Start with a kind of short background story of how you got
                    interested in science during your childhood, what motivated
                    you to take up engineering and your hard work in clearing

                  <li>
                    Then, describe your academic experiences, important
                    internships, projects, relevant courses, and publications.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You may discuss your hobbies, any social work you have
                    undertaken, your teaching experience (e.g., academic
                    mentor), etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An important point which you should include is the answer to
                    the question- Why do you want to study at that university?
                    While answering this question, don’t simply write that you
                    are applying because that university is the best in the
                    world and studying there will change your life. Talk about
                    their academic program, research facilities, significant
                    publications by professors, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Present your research interests, skills and work experiences
                    in a manner that will show that the research being done by
                    professors in that university resonates with your interests
                    and you will be a handy person to have in their research
                    group.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Always write different SOPs for each university. Though this
                    takes up time but gives the impression that you have
                    researched well before applying and are seriously interested
                    in studying at that university.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Try to get your SOP checked by your close ones. These can be
                    friends, seniors, professors, or family members.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Always think about the impact your every sentence can have
                    on the members of the graduate admissions committee. Choose
                    your words judiciously.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don’t make your SOP too long. Reviewers have to review
                    hundreds of applications and don’t have much time. Two pages
                    of single-spaced lines are enough.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                  <strong>Letters of Recommendation</strong><br />
                  LoRs are another important part of the application. Most
                  universities require three letters of recommendation; some
                  require only two although you can submit more if you want.
                  These LoRs can be written by professors, previous employers,
                  etc. You may also take a letter from your project manager if
                  you went for a company internship, for research interns, you
                  can take one from your research internship supervisor. Most
                  universities explicitly mention that you have to take at least
                  one LoR from a professor. I took two LoRs from professors at
                  IITK and one from my research internship supervisor.
                  <br /><br />
                  For taking an LoR from someone, first, seek permission from
                  him/her and fill in his/her email and other details in the
                  online application form. Then you can send a recommendation
                  request to your recommender through the online application
                  portal. Keep sending timely reminders to the recommenders and
                  make sure that they are aware of the deadlines. I would
                  recommend you to take LoRs from those professors who know you
                  personally and are familiar with your scholastic and academic
                  credentials.<br /><br />

                  The rough timeline I followed was :
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Prepared for GRE and TOEFL – August</li>
                  <li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Shortlisted universities- after mid sems in September and
                    October
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Started writing SOPs, requesting professors for LORs-
                    November
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Completed application forms, uploaded transcripts, reviewed
                    SOPs- December
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br /><br />
