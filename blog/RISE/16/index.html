                                I spent my Summer of 2019, a full two and a half months at Bioinorganic Chemistry
                                Research group at the University of Greifswald, working on the synthesis of novel
                                NHC(N-Heterocyclic Carbene) dithiolene compounds for reduction of nitrogen to ammonia.
                                The project was based on the combination of my interest in small molecule activation
                                along with the group's main focus - Bioinorganic Chemistry. Phew! I know that sounds
                                heavy but don't worry, I am here to share my experience and that might be helpful when
                                you come at a crossroads in your Summers.

                                <h4>Getting the Internship</h4><br />
                                Since I had an immensely motivating experience in my past internship at IIT Bombay,
                                which revolved around Synthetic Inorganic Chemistry, I was determined to look for an
                                academic internship for next year's summer intern too. With the aspirations to explore
                                my department further and not drift towards other options (like sitting for the SPO
                                internship season), I started applying for an academic research internship. I searched
                                for groups working on ‘Small Molecule Activation’. As my primary objective, I worked
                                towards preparing relevant documents such as my cover letter and research CV. Inputs
                                from seniors proved to be very helpful while developing these documents with utmost
                                cogency. Since my grades were decent but not exceptional, I focussed mainly on mailing
                                different labs across the world rather than focusing on various research internship
                                programs (I did apply to all the programs though :P). I sent most of the mails during
                                the vacations (midsem and winters) but received my first proper response at the start of
                                January. By the end of March, I received my VISA, and yeah, I was on cloud nine.

                            <p>
                                For all of my juniors who are reading this, I would like to stress on <b>a few important
                                    things</b> to keep in mind while mailing professors:-

                                <br />
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The timing of mail should be adjusted according to the time zone of the
                                        professor's country. All the mails I sent unknowingly during the new year and
                                        Christmas period went unattended, so keep in mind to not send emails during that
                                        period(This period could be different from country to country)</li>
                                    <li> The cover letter should be presented as indigenous and lucid to the receiver,
                                        i.e., the professor should feel the mail is intended especially towards him/her.
                                        At the end of my internship, my professor told me that the major reason she
                                        offered me the internship was the utmost desire I showed her while applying,
                                        which only comes if your mails are well framed and characteristic/unique.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Being Resilient while sending mails. I remember sending some 120 odd letters
                                        before getting a positive response. In most of the cases, your mails may go
                                        unattended by the professors while some may respond, although not with any
                                        positive news, and others may not offer you any support. Therefore, don't get
                                        dejected and be resolute throughout to get a prompt response.
                                        <br/>
                                        I cannot emphasize enough the importance of consistent mailing and timely
                                        reminders. Therefore, it is essential not to wait for the results of the
                                        programs and to keep mailing until you receive an offer.<br/>
                                        Although one may perceive applying to programs as an effort in vain, It
                                        distinctly helped me improve at things like making an SOP required for various
                                        programs and meet application deadlines (especially with the recommendations
                                        :P).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>It is also imperative to not get distracted by your batchmates sitting in the
                                        SPO intern season as many of them would receive confirmed offers much before you
                                        do and would be having fun: gaming nights, binge-watching movies, phatta,
                                        football, and whatnot.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <br /><br />
                                <h4>Experience of working in the lab</h4>
                                <br />
                                <b>About the workplace:</b><br />
                                My lab was situated at the Institute for Biochemistry, University of Greifswald.
                                Initially, I was a bit skeptical of the university's rank, but having spoken with a
                                senior who had earlier been an intern there, I went ahead with the plan. Few days after
                                working in the chemistry lab, I realized how naive it would have been to reject the
                                opportunity based on ranking. In Germany, the funding and research facilities are
                                provided by the government without any bias between the universities. The labs were well
                                equipped with characterization facilities, glassware, cleaning equipment (we even had a
                                dishwasher for washing dirty lab glassware :) ) and the safety features. The systematic
                                adherence to safety protocols, proper cleanliness organizational measures made the lab
                                environment very conducive for working.<br/><br/>
                                <img src="i1.png" class="blog-img" style="float:left" /><br/>
                                <b>About my work:</b><br />
                                Before commencing, I received a hands-on safety lecture by one of the junior professors
                                in the group. He explained things such as handling the fire extinguishers, the use of
                                fumehood's window for the protection of face, safe disposal of the broken glassware, and
                                other rudimentary guidelines. From the first day itself, I acquired a decent amount of
                                workload that my mentor had already planned for me. My main task was to synthesize a
                                dithiolene molybdenum carbonyl complex and attach an NHC(N-heterocyclic Carbene) group
                                to it and test it for Nitrogen activation. Working with the NHCs requires extremely
                                air-sensitive conditions in which my mentor trained me. The training included drying of
                                solvents, i.e., making it water-free, using the schlenk lines and glove box. I also
                                worked with the photochemical apparatus, which was used to perform the light-induced
                                reactions. After completing the experiments, I used to jot down the details of the
                                reactions in my lab journal, which was a vital task that would prove to be helpful while
                                organizing and drafting my next reaction. A typical reaction would take about 3-4 days
                                to complete after which it could be kept for crystallization. From my experience, the
                                crystallization of air-sensitive compounds was one of the most challenging tasks I came
                                across.
                                <br />
                                After days of hard work, finally, I had my ‘Eureka moment’ when the X-ray results of the
                                crystals displayed the success of my experiment, I had synthesized a mono-NHC complex,
                                i.e., one NHC group attached to Molybdenum. I was able to characterize it with IR and
                                NMR techniques.

                                During the internship period, many guest lectures were organized at the institute. Since
                                these lectures were attended by nearly all the UG & PG students of the department, this
                                inculcated a fresh and rewarding practice, which I made sure to sustain even after
                                returning to India. For those of you aspiring for higher studies, I would highly
                                recommend attending these guest lectures that regularly take place in our institute.<br/><br/>
                                <img src="i2.png" class="blog-img" style="float:right" /><br/>
                                <b>Challenges faced:</b><br />
                                It was not a very straightforward ride for me from the beginning as I faced two
                                significant challenges in adapting to the work culture of the lab(or you can say Germany
                                in general). The first one being the early work hours. Most of the professional
                                activities closed in by the evening(except public transport) contradictory to our
                                lifestyle back home. Secondly, performing the experiments independently. Since I was
                                well equipped due to my meticulous training, my mentor expected me to handle even the
                                costliest and most sensitive of the instruments on my own. This was a bit of a contrast
                                to what I had been acquitted to till then. The support of my mentor ensured that I fared
                                well. <br/><br/>

                            
                                <h4>Life outside the lab</h4><br />
                                Living all by myself was a fantastic experience which came with its own set of
                                challenges and learnings. I cooked breakfast and dinner myself (due to exorbitant
                                prices), and as much as I enjoyed cooking, it dawned upon me how difficult it is to cook
                                Indian food. :-)
                                <img src="i3.png" class="blog-img" style="float:left" />
                                <br />
                                At lunch, I was usually accompanied by two fellow bachelor students and we enjoyed
                                interesting discussions about their lives as undergraduates at the university dining
                                hall. On weekends, I used to hang out with my group mates at the city harbor, which was
                                a beautiful place with vintage ships converted into restaurants. We used to have a beer
                                and relax there. We had some very intriguing discussions on scientific and
                                non-scientific subjects, which eventually grew our bond.

                                <br />
                                Traveling is very costly in Europe, but you can cut down your expenses if you plan well.
                                I visited Rugen and Usedom, two islands situated in the 40 km proximity of Greifswald.
                                During my trip to Rugen which involved a 16 km trek, I met a hearty German couple from
                                Cologne. I used to believe that Germans hold a reserved personality, but this couple
                                broke this dilemma. I had fun chatting with them throughout the trek.

                                <br /><br />
                                
                                I also managed to visit the neighboring countries; the Netherlands, Denmark, and
                                Czechia. The experience of visiting each country was unique, and I learnt many new
                                things and made numerous memories.


                                <br /><br />
                                <h4>Summing Up</h4><br />
                                While it was a hard and cumbersome process to get this internship, if I were asked to
                                describe my experience in one word, it would be <b>"Amazing”</b>. Living independently in a
                                culturally different environment helped me view things from different lenses and brought
                                out the compassion in me.

                                <br /><br />

                                <br /><br />
                                I developed a more holistic view of my subject and how research is done. I experienced
                                different cultures and met new people. This multi-dimensional experience has not only
                                changed me as a researcher but also as a person. The foreign internship was one of a
                                kind experience for me, and I hope it turns out to be exhilarating for you, too, in case
                                you are planning to take it up.

                                <br /><br />
                                <h4>Acknowledgments</h4><br />
                                I am indebted to <b>Prof. Carola Schulzke</b> for providing me this fantastic opportunity.
                                Without her support, it would have been impossible for me to have gained much
                                experience. I thank the <b>University of Greifswald</b> and <b>Prof. Schulzke</b> for arranging the
                                financial assistance, which helped me cover my subsistence costs. I would also like to
                                thank <b>MSc. Benedict Elvers</b>, my mentor and an exemplary inorganic chemist who had been so
                                patient with me throughout my journey and also in whom I found a great friend.
