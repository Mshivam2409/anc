                <p>
                  Last year during this time, I was sitting in my room and
                  wondering if I‚Äôll secure a software internship in one of the
                  reputed companies or not. I had heard that most of these
                  ‚Äúreputed‚Äù companies come in the first week itself, and I
                  hadn‚Äôt secured an internship yet at the end of it. I could see
                  those getting selected celebrating, and facebook getting
                  filled with congratulatory posts. This is a moment, when the
                  sense of desperation kicks in for the first time, which a lot
                  of you might face and you start getting serious (hopefully).
                  <br /><br />
                  One of the mistakes I did was that I wasted my summer vacation
                  not doing any preparations, something that I would strictly
                  advise against. It is a golden time, when you don‚Äôt have the
                  pressure and lots of time to learn and master new things. As a
                  result, when the semester started, and it was already late, I
                  started preparing in whatever time I had. I was not very sure
                  about my software skills, so I also decided to apply to the
                  core EE companies as well. I had also decided to try for some
                  research intern through one of the academic programs, as a
                  backup. So I had filled the ‚ÄúAcademic Intern‚Äù preference in
                  SPO - which gives me the right to choose an academic intern
                  secured separately over an industry intern secured through
                  SPO.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  With these in mind, I started practising coding from CodeChef,
                  LeetCode and GeeksForGeeks. I revised all the algorithms that
                  I learnt in ESO207 - Data Structures and Algorithms. I started
                  focusing on the interview questions for different companies
                  from GeeksForGeeks. I also did the weekly coding contests in
                  LeetCode (which I suggest people to start from the summer
                  vacation), which had questions that were well designed for
                  recruitment tests. I also revised some of my EE courses for
                  some EE profiles that I had thought of applying to.
                  <br /><br />
                  Trying to do all of this was already difficult in the short
                  time, and now there was the added pressure of not having
                  secured an intern after the first week. It was the second
                  week, and I had given the test rounds for Samsung Bangalore
                  and Adobe India, whose results were yet to come. Both had come
                  for a Research Intern profile, and I thought it would be a
                  good experience of both research and corporate life, so I
                  applied in them. I had read in similar articles (like this)
                  from seniors that they got selected in Adobe just on the basis
                  of their 9.5+ CPI. But, I didn‚Äôt have such an outstanding CPI,
                  so I had to go through the test round first. Nevertheless, I
                  had less expectation from Adobe, and was looking forward to an
                  interview call from Samsung.
                  <br /><br />
                  The reverse happened. I got a call on the following Sunday
                  morning, that I have an interview scheduled for Adobe at
                  around 10 am. I rushed, had breakfast and got dressed up in
                  formals. Reaching the place in a hurry, I was told that the
                  interview has been postponed to 12pm, and it was going to be
                  an over-the-phone interview. I wondered why I had rushed to
                  dressed up so formally! üòõ
                  <br /><br />

                  So finally, at 12:05 pm, I got a call from an interviewer from
                  Adobe. Starting with some introductions, he told me to go
                  through my resume. I had nothing overly stated in my resume,
                  so I confidently went through whatever little there was that I
                  had done. Then he sent me a link to a Google Doc, and told me
                  to type answers to the questions that he was going to ask. He
                  asked me 3 questions. The first was a question that checked my
                  object oriented skills. I was told to make a class that
                  represents a probability distribution, which would contain
                  methods for calculating mean, median, expectations and some
                  others functions. Initially I had some confusion, but
                  eventually I was able to come up with a solution that the
                  interviewer seemed to be satisfied with. In his second
                  question, he asked me to write an algorithm for finding the
                  median, or in general, any kth ranked element from a
                  constantly updating list. I had come up with a modified
                  version of quicksort that finds the kth element instead. The
                  interviewer seemed to be satisfied with the answer, but later
                  I realised the best solution was using two heaps. The third
                  question was from Linear Algebra and included some eigenvalues
                  and other stuff that I didn‚Äôt remember well from MTH102. I
                  tried for about 2 mins, but then was honest about it and told
                  him that I didn‚Äôt remember it. Then he ended the interview by
                  stating that it was all he had to ask and it was a good time
                  interviewing me.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt go well!‚Äù - that was my impression of the
                  interview. I didn‚Äôt give the most optimal solution for the
                  second question, and I couldn‚Äôt answer the third question at
                  all. I consoled myself with the thought that I was anyway not
                  expecting a selection to Adobe, and tried to focus on what was
                  ahead. It was evening, and I tried to open the Internship
                  portal, only to find that I couldn‚Äôt login anymore. Initially
                  worried what was wrong, I quickly checked my email to find
                  that I was selected for the summer internship at Adobe! It was
                  a moment of joy, and suddenly I was on the other side of the
                  line, where I had been seeing so many people getting to over
                  the last week. Although relatively short, I would say applying
                  for internships was a good experience, where I experienced
                  both the downsides and the upsides of it - enough to write
                  this article today. üòõ
                  <br /><br />
                  The internship started on May 7th. All the interns were
                  assigned to the same Big Data Experience Lab of Adobe at
                  Bangalore. We were provided with flight tickets (both to and
                  fro) and given a temporary accommodation at a 5 star hotel for
                  the initial 2 weeks. After that, we had to pay and manage our
                  own accomodation. On the first day, we had an orientation
                  where we were made aware of the values and the ways of Adobe.
                  We were also given a small tour of the 10 floor office
                  building, where we came to know all the perks and facilities
                  available to the employees. There was a gym, facilities for
                  various indoor games like TT, football, carom and pool, a
                  pantry on every floor for tea/coffee/maggi anytime, and a
                  cafeteria where you get free lunch and dinner (if you stay
                  late). There is no strict dress-code at Adobe, nor is there
                  any strict office hours, as Adobe doesn‚Äôt have a concept of
                  time-in or time-out, but we usually came at around 10am and
                  left at around 8pm, after having dinner from the cafeteria.
                  Also, if you come to office on Sundays, you get to order free
                  food from any nearby restaurants, which was a major attraction
                  for the interns to work on weekends. üòõ
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />

                  We were divided into teams of 2-3 interns and 2 mentors each.
                  The mentors were employees from the lab who had enough
                  experience and knowledge in the problem area we would be
                  working on. No team had two interns from the same college, and
                  even mentors were tried to be assigned such that they were not
                  alumnis of any of the intern‚Äôs colleges. The problem area
                  given to any team was mostly random, while keeping the
                  constraint that they were in the domain of our mentors. Most
                  of the problem areas involved some use of Machine Learning, so
                  having a little prior experience in the field helps.
                  <br /><br />
                  The internship period was nicely structured into two main
                  phases. The first phase was a problem choosing phase, where we
                  had to finalize the problem we will be working on, from a vast
                  problem area that we were given initially. We were required to
                  read a lot of state of the art papers and come up with unique
                  ideas. The first month of our two and a half month internship
                  went in narrowing down to one problem statement that was
                  really innovative, hard, research worthy and in the domain of
                  Adobe. Then we defended it in front of all senior members at
                  Adobe and got it accepted as our problem statement for the
                  internship.
                  <br /><br />
                  The second phase was about figuring out a solution approach to
                  the problem, and then creating/implementing models, coding
                  different parts and experimenting various hypotheses. We
                  implemented about 12 different models from various state of
                  the art papers and created a pipeline of our own, that tried
                  to solve our chosen problem statement. Finally, we had to
                  present a demo at a Tech Fair, where the senior members of
                  Adobe asked questions about our project and we explained the
                  details of it. The entire experience was enriching, and we
                  learnt a lot about our research field, as well as about the
                  process of industrial research in general.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image4.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />

                  Even though the working durations were slightly hectic, we had
                  a lot of fun in between. We were taken to treats by our
                  mentors to one of the costliest hotels in Bangalore, two times
                  - once after the Problem Defence, and once after our Final
                  Demo. We also had a trip organised by Adobe for all the
                  interns. We were taken to a resort in Bangalore, where a lot
                  of activities were organised, and it was a lot of fun! We also
                  celebrated the birthday of one of my teammates in the office
                  itself at midnight with cakes and birthday bombs. Towards the
                  end, there was a farewell party as well, where some delicious
                  dishes were present. Besides these, the mentors in general
                  were very friendly, and even in meetings we would at times
                  laugh or crack some relevant jokes. New bonds were formed with
                  our teammates, and even with the other teams in our cubicle.
                  <br /><br />
                  Overall, it was a very well structured, organised internship
                  that gave us a lot of insight into industrial research as well
                  as corporate life in general. I would highly recommend people
                  to try and come at Adobe, and live this enriching experience
                  themselves. Added bonus: You‚Äôll most likely get a patent or
                  paper in one of the prestigious journals out of this
                  internship, if you give some genuine efforts, which most
                  interns give here. It is a rare feat that very few industrial
                  internships will give you.
                  <br /><br />
                  Best of luck for your endeavours!
