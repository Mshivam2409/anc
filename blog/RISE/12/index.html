                <p>
                  Hello people ! I am Anurag Pandey, a final year undergraduate
                  in the department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing. I
                  interned at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore as a Summer Analyst in
                  Risk Division.
                  <br /><br />
                  Talking about career, internships play a vital role in helping
                  one decide what to go for, or atleast what not to go for.
                  Before digging deeper into various options, one needs to
                  figure out if it has to be an academic or industry intern. In
                  my case, I had already tried academia in my second year that I
                  wanted something a bit more fast paced. Hence I chose to go
                  for an industry intern in the third year summers.
                  <br /><br />
                  Well, most of the people in our campus take the intern season
                  lightly and do not prepare. I think this needs to change. One
                  thing which I realized during the entire internship season is
                  that the companies usually do not want the best guy, they just
                  want a guy suitable for their job. So a good enough
                  preparation would definitely prove useful. In my case I
                  started my preparation somewhere near early July.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  I knew I had an interest in algorithms and mathematics, so I
                  decided to go for the software and analyst roles. Among the
                  offers I had on day 1, Goldman seemed to me a pretty good
                  choice as it is a big name ( and also a lucrative offer xD ).
                  <br /><br />

                  Talking about the selection procedure, Goldman Sachs comes on
                  day 1 of the intern recruitment drive. There is an initial
                  screening test consisting of coding and quant problems,
                  followed by a couple of rounds of interview. The difficulty
                  level of problems asked in the screening test and interview
                  are somewhere from moderate to difficult. But then you can
                  surely do well with a decent level of preparation.
                  <br /><br />
                  Coming to the most important part - life at Goldman Sachs !
                  For those of you who do not know, Goldman Sachs is one of the
                  biggest Investment Bank in the world and it also offers a
                  variety of other financial services.
                  <br /><br />
                  There is a common notion in the campus community that Goldman
                  follows strict formals culture and has long working hours.
                  That is not exactly true. It is more or less team dependent.
                  But then from what I experienced, most of the teams are okay
                  with casuals. As far as long working hours is considered, you
                  can come and go anytime as long as your project is going on
                  track. But then you would want to spend most of your time on
                  the weekdays in office - going to the gym or bulla sessions
                  with seniors and/or co-interns in the cafeteria, if not
                  working. Also very rarely in some of the teams, you are
                  required to come to office on Saturdays, otherwise it is
                  usually a 5 days a week.
                  <br /><br />

                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  The next best thing
                  <u
                    >about Goldman is flat hierarchy. Everyone in the team right
                    from interns to the VPs used to sit together side-by-side on
                    the same table.</u
                  >
                  There is no cubicle system. You can approach anyone with any
                  doubts. Also the projects you would be working upon wonâ€™t be
                  some dummy projects. You would be working on certain aspects
                  of a bigger ongoing project. They make sure that it has got
                  sufficient learning for the intern and that the project is
                  doable. Goldman believes in grilling you to bring the best out
                  of you. At times you might feel that you cannot accomplish the
                  task, but then you should keep going and seek help, if
                  necessary. The feeling when you accomplish these challenging
                  tasks is unparalleled. <br /><br />

                  Other perks of working in Investment banks is you get to party
                  a lot ! I remember having a team party atleast once in a
                  fortnight! We went for sports, escape room, restro bars, and
                  house parties. Also it is usually sponsored by the firm or
                  seniors, which further adds to the fun xD.
                  <br /><br />
                  To sum up, this summer was like a roller coaster ride - full
                  of ups and downs, but at the end the experience was something
                  worth remembering.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Third year summer intern is also important from other
                  perspectives apart from career. So you should not just
                  completely dive into work, with the goal of PPO, but also set
                  time aside to explore the place, talk to new people, make
                  connections and also get to know yourself in a better fashion.
                  These things will be far more valuable in the long run than
                  some PPO which saves you from four months of hard work during
                  the placements. So make sure whatever you do, you make the
                  best out of it. If not much, at least it should be a time you
                  look back to with a smile on your face.
                  <br /><br />

                  For the freshmen and sophomores reading this, do not neglect
                  CPI at anypoint as it eventually matters at a number of places
                  if not all. Have fun during your stay in campus but meanwhile
                  also connect to a number of professors and seniors and explore
                  anything and everything that you want to.
                  <br /><br />
                  Good luck everyone with all your future pursuits ! Feel free
                  to reach out to me if you want to discuss any of these things.
