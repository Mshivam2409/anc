                      If you are reading this blog series, I would say you have
                      taken the first step towards getting into higher education
                      i.e. taking it into consideration! You might find this
                      astounding, depending on your inclinations and thought
                      process, but a lot of students don’t ever consider higher

                      Last year during this time, I was sitting in my room and

                      the reputed companies or not. I had heard that most of
                      these “reputed” companies come in the first week itself,
                      and I hadn’t secured an internship yet at the end of it..

                      While deciding on the third year summer internship, the
                      first step is to decide whether you want to go for an
                      academic or an industry internship. If you have a decent
                      interest in both, it would require some introspection. Ask
                      yourself, what are your expectations out of the two
                      months.

                      After completing my fourth semester, I was in a dilemma as
                      to what my interests actually were. Was there something I
                      was good at or whether I should prepare for the coming
                      internship season or look for an academic internship.

                      “Nahin maa, abhi tak kisi ka reply nahin aaya.” As I sat
                      on the stairs of the library, the somberness in this
                      reiterating expression overpowered my fear for MSE301’s
                      end sem. This thought of not getting an intern had been
                      bothering me for a while (rather an entire semester).
                      Maybe this fear was going to daunt me some more...
