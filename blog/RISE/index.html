                    I received two valuable pieces of advice in my first year which I feel are relevant to the
                    people about to embark on a research track in college. A professor said, “Don’t worry about
                    jobs – you are IITians, if anyone is desirable in the job market, it is you! So, don’t worry
                    about the prevalent opinion that trying out research will make you less hireable”.

                    Since my early days at IITK, I have been interested in research in pure mathematics. Thanks
                    to a project I did with Prof. Mohua Banerjee, during my second year summers, I got
                    especially interested in mathematical logic. Hence, I chose to pursue research in
                    mathematical logic for my internship. Although I applied to almost all the intern programs
                    with opportunities in logic, I could not get an internship through any programs.

                    With the world coming to a stand still, I’ve come to appreciate sehnsucht - a beautiful
                    German word which roughly translates to a deep feeling of longing for something that is
                    missing, like wanting to escape the present to the past or the future. Not knowing how
                    the upcoming summer will be, I find myself wishing I go back to the last summer, and
                    writing this piece was a great way to do that.
                    <br />Before I start, I should point out that everyone’s experience is unique. For me,
                    it was a rollercoaster - I was very lucky most of the time, and many times I was
                    disappointed and disheartened too. I did learn a lot from the journey, though, and had a
                    wonderful time interning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in
                    Tübingen, Germany.

                    The penultimate year is quite a crucial period of our stay at IIT Kanpur. Amid the academic and
                    extracurricular commitments, you have to plan the undertakings for the upcoming summers. The idea of
                    going to a new city to explore corporate life or getting a taste of research at a foriegn University
                    is exciting but later on, it might get overwhelming over the multitude of available choices --
                    whether to choose an academic or corporate intern, should I target simply the core profiles or keep
                    the non-core profiles in the picture too. I remember living this scenario at the end of 4th
                    semester, having little clue of the internship process, wondering how to proceed. What I have seen
                    is that it is the case for most of us at some stage. It happens to be the first time you would be
                    joining the corporate world or flying overseas to experience another reality altogether.

                    I spent my Summer of 2019, a full two and a half months at Bioinorganic Chemistry Research group at
                    the University of Greifswald, working on the synthesis of novel NHC(N-Heterocyclic Carbene)
                    dithiolene compounds for reduction of nitrogen to ammonia. The project was based on the combination
                    of my interest in small molecule activation along with the group's main focus - Bioinorganic
                    Chemistry. Phew! I know that sounds heavy but don't worry, I am here to share my experience and that

                    Dufresne, The Shawshank Redemption Well, I guess this summarizes my philosophy in
                    approaching this internship. I had an interesting summer last year at NYU Tandon School
                    of Engineering which exposed me to the wonderful ocean of opportunities called 5G.
                    However, I wanted more. I took the decision of staying back at IIT Kanpur for another
                    year as a Dual Degree student and started working with Prof Rohit Budhiraja who
                    currently is my thesis supervisor. I also decided to give another shot at a research
                    internship abroad. As it turned out, I got selected for the 2019 cohort of the SN Bose
                    Scholars’ Program and took this opportunity to secure an internship offer from Prof.
                    Xinyu Zhang, University of California, San Diego. I was already acquainted with the visa
                    procedures and with all that done, I safely landed in the US on 11th May.

                    Standing at the cusp of the next step in my academic journey - going to grad school - I
                    can't help but look back often at the road that led me here. It doesn't help (or perhaps
                    it does, depending on your point of view) that a lot of my conversations now revolve
                    around internship or grad school applications. Somehow, I'm surrounded by people
                    interested in exploring or pursuing a career in academia. And with these thoughts fresh

                    Last year during this time, I was sitting in my room and
                    wondering if I’ll secure a software internship in one of
                    the reputed companies or not. I had heard that most of
                    these “reputed” companies come in the first week itself,
                    and I hadn’t secured an internship yet at the end of it..

                    While deciding on the third year summer internship, the
                    first step is to decide whether you want to go for an
                    academic or an industry internship. If you have a decent
                    interest in both, it would require some introspection. Ask
                    yourself, what are your expectations out of the two
                    months.

                    As I entered L13, a little later than the stipulated time,
                    I saw numerous eager faces occupying not just all the
                    chairs but also the floor to listen to how to get a good
                    Masters or PhD position after graduation. This was a
                    session organised by the AnC to help students get
                    acquainted with the application process for higher
                    education, and I was one of the speakers.

                    on the stairs of the library, the somberness in this
