                  In the seventh article of the blog series - RISE,
                  <strong>Koushani Das</strong>, an undergraduate student in the
                  ​ Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering from
                  the Y15 batch walks us through her journey in the field of
                  research at IITK and abroad. She did her summer internship
                  from the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany. This blog gives
                  insights of the application procedure and internship
                  experiences that she had.<br /><br />

                <p>
                  Having recently completed a Bachelors of Biological Sciences
                  and Bioengineering from IITK, I have come to an utmost
                  conclusion that research demands sheer dedication and immense
                  passion. Just like every other bewildered sophomore, I headed
                  towards research with a mindset to fill up quality content for
                  my resume! In this span of 4 years, I managed to have done an
                  internship with Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), a
                  BIRAC funded project, academic internship in Germany and
                  finally mentored an IGEM project held at Hynes Convention
                  Center, Boston. <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Well, it still takes a minute for me to fathom how I traversed
                  from one opportunity to another, mostly due to a sudden
                  developed interest in research with due course of time. So, in
                  this article I am going to present a step by step personal
                  experience of what attracted me to research, major hurdles
                  faced and how to overcome those. And just like people say
                  “BSBE main koi future nahi hai” trust me it’s just a gibberish
                  comment.<br /><br />
                  So, right from my third semester of study, I joined Prof.
                  Saravanan Matheshwaran’s lab and since then I got introduced
                  to Gel electrophoresis, culturing of bacteria, streaking on a
                  culture plate and the whole scenario of diligently working in
                  a lab. These advanced techniques fascinated me and soon after
                  that I applied to CDRI- CSIR labs where I got noticed by Dr.
                  Sukant Khurana who willingly offered me a project covering
                  neurological disorders including Parkinson’s project. I worked
                  under his guidance for over a year where we shared weekly
                  Skype calls discussing my progress and eventually my
                  formulated articles were published in his journal.
                  Immediately, after my fifth semester, our HOD sent a mail
                  across the department for participation in a BIRAC funded
                  project in Ahmedabad. So, I received an opportunity to spend
                  the winters in Gujarat, where I got exposed to lab techniques
                  like spectroscopy, HPLC, TLC, various extraction methods and
                  fortunately I was awarded the BIRAC grant to continue the
                  project in IITK.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  Simultaneously, my main intention was to secure a descent
                  academic internship during third year summers and hence I paid
                  particular attention towards strengthening my lab skills prior
                  to any international exposure. Technically, securing an
                  academic internship abroad is stated as ‘luck dependent’ or
                  ‘very high CPI requirement’. But, neither did I have a very
                  high CPI nor was I extremely lucky! Hence, I did put
                  sufficient effort into formatting my resume, motivation letter
                  (listed down my accomplishments and future goals honestly) and
                  also recommendation letters (It’s pretty easy to obtain
                  recommendation letters from department of BSBE!). Moreover, I
                  started preparing my resume during second year summers with
                  immense help and advice from seniors. Trust me, securing a
                  descent international internship completely lies in your
                  resume, how you build it up strategically that will surely
                  capture the eyes of your employer (often a well-established
                  research experience sparkles more than your CPI!). So right
                  from the beginning of fifth semester, I jotted down various
                  institute and related professors that complemented with my
                  specific research interest (I was sure of not sitting for
                  internship season). Since, applying off program is a very
                  tedious job (people send 40 mails and get back 2 or 3 replies,
                  mostly self-funded), I majorly focused on a fully funded
                  internship that would suffice my stay abroad. Moreover,
                  travelling has always been a matter of interest hence a
                  foreign internship would suffice both of my clauses –
                  enrichment of knowledge as well as exploring cultural
                  diversity! <br /><br />
                  “Rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the
                  pursuit of success”. The fear of rejection is one of the key
                  elements to any foreign internship. Hence, dealing with it, I
                  got rejected from some of the very prominent programs, but
                  without losing hope and seeing my friends securing high paid
                  company internships, I strictly focused on my research
                  application. Eventually, I came across an exchange program
                  known as IAESTE (International Association of Exchange
                  Students Technical Experience) India, which basically enabled
                  exchange of students who aimed at pursuing technical
                  experience abroad. Hence, I applied to this program and filled
                  out my preference for Dr. Leichert of Ruhr University of
                  Bochum, Germany. This university was supposedly established in
                  1962 and the very first public university in Germany after
                  World War II. Hence in February 2018, I got accepted to this
                  university since the professor was impressed by my resume and
                  thought it was ‘quite detailed and long’ unlike that of German
                  resumes! The professor was very student friendly and he
                  offered me with DAAD scholarship which covered my entire
                  expenditure along with extra fund for travelling across
                  Europe! The best things definitely occur unexpectedly. My
                  three months of stay in Europe couldn’t have been more
                  exhilarating.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Eventually, I was guided by a German student representative
                  who looked after my stay, provided me with work visa, and also
                  with other essentials. Since I was the youngest in lab, my
                  colleagues were extremely affectionate, taught me lab ethics
                  from scratch and made me feel like home. My lab mates along
                  with the professor would have lunch together and we had our
                  weekly hangouts. My research was specifically based on
                  Biochemistry where I performed protein purification and
                  studied the effect of the purified proteins on Hypochlorous
                  acid mimicking the condition of an infected human. Apart from
                  my nine to five job, I managed to travel across Germany,
                  Netherlands, France and Switzerland (my professor had a huge
                  role in planning my trips!). In total, I had accomplished an
                  enriched experience both culturally as well as
                  academically.<br /><br />
                  The department of BSBE also provides Summer Innovation Award
                  (Joy and Manmohan Gill Endowment Fund) to students who
                  complete quality internship during their third-year summers in
                  academia as well as in company. I would like to thank my
                  professor immensely for his cooperative support due to which I
                  also managed to receive the First prize in Summer Innovation
                  Award’2018 organized by the department of BSBE.
                  <br /><br />
                  Four years at IIT Kanpur was full of surprises when I expected
                  the least. And just like Einstein said “Anyone who has never
                  made a mistake, has never tried anything new”, hence
                  irrespective of what people say, focus on yourself and what
                  you believe in. Stay alert about the programs, its deadline
                  and start early as possible. The first thing to keep in mind
                  is to have a research interest before aiming for any foreign
                  internship, a lot of patience and belief in oneself!
