                <p>
                  Hello folks, I am Shruti Shukla, a senior undergraduate
                  student in the Department of Electrical Engineering. I
                  interned at Texas Instruments (TI), Bangalore in the
                  Summers’19 as an Analog Intern. <br /><br />
                  While deciding on the third year summer internship, the first
                  step is to decide whether you want to go for an academic or an
                  industry internship. If you have a decent interest in both, it
                  would require some introspection. Ask yourself, what are your
                  expectations out of the two months. I strongly suggest
                  connecting with seniors, who have been in your place before. I
                  spoke to multiple seniors with different internships and
                  finally concluded my best-suited option. This would vary
                  according to your priorities, so it is important to spend some
                  time going over this to avoid making an uninformed decision.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  I decided this was the best time to explore the industry
                  because it could help me figure out if I wanted to work in a
                  company set-up after my undergraduate studies or not. I had
                  UGPs planned in the upcoming two semesters, and converting to
                  dual would always be an option to try research in case this
                  internship didn’t work out for me.<br /><br />
                  After this came the question of which companies I wanted to
                  apply to. The decision leading up to my internship at TI was
                  mostly guided by my decision not to apply for (read: prepare
                  seriously for) software and analyst profiles. The reason for
                  this was because I disliked coding and related work. Later on,
                  during my internship and subsequent UGPs, I finally realized
                  that you cannot ignore coding altogether, it is an important
                  skill to have, but yes, the type is certainly different from
                  what software profiles ask for, so it was okay for me. I liked
                  my departmental subjects so, core electrical profiles seemed
                  the best option for me. <br /><br />

                  Texas Instruments came on day 3 of the internship season. The
                  shortlisting was done based on a written test consisting of 4
                  sections- software, analog, digital and aptitude. It would be
                  good to ask seniors selected in respective profiles regarding
                  what type of questions are expected, preparation strategy,
                  etc. People were shortlisted in multiple profiles depending on
                  their test scores, I was selected in the Analog profile. If
                  you decently revise ESC201, EE210, and EE250, the test can be
                  cracked easily, as most questions were on basic circuit
                  theory, some on Op-Amps and a bit on Bode Plots. For the
                  aptitude section, some mock tests on pariksha.co could be
                  helpful. <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  As for the interviews, there was one technical round followed
                  by one HR round. The interviewers didn’t even look at the
                  resume during the interview, they wanted to check one’s
                  intuition, and whether you have an in-depth understanding of
                  how basic circuit elements like capacitors work. Most of the
                  interview was based on RC Circuits and Op-Amps. Some basic
                  preparation resources are electronics-tutorials.ws, NPTL
                  lectures or youtube videos by IITM Prof Nagendra Krishnapura
                  on First Order Circuits and Op-Amps. If you have worked on a
                  circuits related project, it’s a plus, but if you haven’t that
                  won’t count as a minus. The HR interview was just a discussion
                  about why you want to join TI and about your future plans.
                  There were ten shortlists from our college (7 in Analog).<br /><br />

                  Before the start of the intern, we were periodically given
                  some quizzes to attempt, with goodies for the winners. Towards
                  the beginning, we were given mentor details who contacted
                  (well, most of) us with project details and related reading
                  material. Not everyone’s mentor did that, and my advice, in
                  this case, is to reach out to the HR on mail beforehand (there
                  are plus points for being proactive). The first week of our
                  internship was orientation (nostalgia to our first week on
                  campus), followed by eight weeks of work. Orientation
                  consisted of sessions by TI senior employees on the kind of
                  work TI does, IT Security sessions and profile specific and
                  Unix training.<br /><br />
                  The thing with TI is that a lot of your internship experience
                  depends on who your mentor there is, over which you have a
                  little control. However, from what I learned from working
                  there is, it is up to you how you handle it. You can have a
                  mentor, who hardly met you during your time, but if you are
                  yourself active, you can learn a lot from the people around
                  you, apart from your mentor. The open cubicle system of TI and
                  the absence of strict hierarchical levels ensure that you can
                  talk to even senior colleagues about things you want to learn.
                  Also, one of the things about TI that I liked, was the
                  flexible work culture. If you’re doing your job sincerely, you
                  can take as many breaks as you like. There is also a facility
                  like our New SAC in TI called Texins which has a music room,
                  badminton courts, TT courts, gym and a lot other sports
                  facilities. All the interns are encouraged to go there as
                  frequently as they’d like. <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Now, about my work - I was given a project to make validation
                  applications using LabVIEW which is a graphical coding
                  software. Thankfully, it was not the coding I was trying to
                  escape and it was cool to learn this software, especially when
                  I came to know of its tremendous applications. However, it was
                  not what I expected from my project, as I had wanted to work
                  on a circuits related project. So, it came up during my
                  mid-term review, that I could be given something different
                  other than LabVIEW. It was a singular thing that generally
                  doesn’t happen with interns, but I was given an opportunity to
                  explore a different team’s project. Though I didn’t fit well
                  there (apparently they worked with Visual C++, so I don’t
                  think I need to explain any further), the fact that I was
                  given this chance made me sure of the fact that, my role in TI
                  would not be some fixed thing set in stone if I joined here as
                  an employee. The senior employees would ensure that I was
                  getting the chance to explore where I fit in. <br /><br />
                  What sets TI apart from other similar companies is that you
                  will be aware of the entire lifecycle of your product. A
                  design engineer will not just design, but will also have
                  active participation in the test engineer’s job and vice
                  versa, which I feel is important if you want to make a
                  holistic career. I received a Pre-Placement Offer after the
                  intern which I have accepted, in the hope of interesting work
                  and because the flexible work environment aligns with my life
                  ideologies. As for the PPO process, the interview consisted of
                  questions on RC Circuits, some general puzzles and mentor
                  feedback. Apart from technical knowledge, the ability to
                  perform and communicate well in a team, TI looks for people
                  who are willing to stay dedicated to the industry for long.
                  So, if you want to work long-term here, an internship would be
                  a great starting point. However, as I mentioned that the
                  process is a bit mentor-dependant, so there is a risk, it
                  might not turn out as you hoped. <br /><br />
                  I also want to say that these two months are for you to
                  explore, not just work but other life aspects as well. The
                  friendships forged during these two months may become stronger
                  than what you’ve had in college, so don’t drown yourself in
                  work with a singular mindset of bagging a PPO. At least with
                  TI, you would have a lot of time to enjoy the city of
                  Bangalore. Weekends would be off, so you can plan a lot of
                  holidays to neighboring places. Go there with an open mindset,
                  give your best and see what’s best for you. <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image4.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  Now some final piece of gyaan. To first years - Do not neglect
                  CPI as it will matter eventually in most places, to second
                  years - explore and start connecting with professors in your
                  field of interest if you want to go for research, or start
                  building skills you would want to reflect on your resume and
                  to third years - Do not fret about what mistakes you have done
                  in your past. Focus on what you know best and what you want,
                  and work with what you have currently, instead of what could
                  have been. My philosophy is to always work the best with what
                  you have currently, and it has seemed to work fine for me.
                  <br /><br />
                  Good luck to all juniors. Feel free to ping me, in case you
                  need to discuss anything related to this.
