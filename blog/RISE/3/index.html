                  In the next article of the blog series
                  <strong>Saakaar Bhatnagar</strong>, an undergraduate student
                  in the Department of Aerospace Engineering from the Y15 batch
                  shares his experience with application procedure to graduate
                  schools in the USA before he finally got admitted to Stanford
                  University for his graduate studies. <br /><br />
                  <em>
                    Stanford University is one of the world’s leading research

                </p>

                <img src="img/cover.jpeg" class="blog-cover" />
                <p>
                  I stepped into the IIT Kanpur campus on 21st July 2015, with
                  all the fears and doubts one associates with living away from
                  home for the first time, certain of only one thing: that for
                  the next four years, I would study Aerospace Engineering. A
                  fascination, that started during my JEE days, with the
                  complexity of flying objects put me on the path I am on today,
                  (almost) a graduate student in the US looking to delve into
                  one of the many subfields of Aerospace Engineering.
                  <br /><br />

                  Starting out, I had some apprehensions being an AE student.
                  Being bombarded with views like “abbe job nahi lagti”, “coding
                  seekh lena”, “core placement zero hai” - made me wonder what
                  the hell I cleared JEE for, certainly not for this negative
                  vibe. However, I had also heard that the AE department at IITK
                  has an excellent international standing, with some leading
                  professors in their respective subfields doing cutting edge
                  research. Hence, I decided that this beast called research
                  should be given a try, and one and a half years later, I found
                  myself applying for graduate school, and was lucky enough to
                  get admitted to some of my top school choices. This article is
                  mostly about the process of application, and I skip my
                  experience of doing research work at IITK and at the
                  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I was a summer
                  research intern. I only applied to schools in the United
                  States, and the following information would be helpful to you
                  if you are considering graduate school in the US. Also, my
                  applications were a mixture of MS and PhD applications, based
                  on a number of factors, including the facilities the
                  university had for my field of interest, the level of
                  difficulty to get into the PhD program for that university,
                  amongst others. This was keeping in mind that my goal was to
                  go into research. <br /><br />

                  The application process for graduate school abroad consists of
                  a long checklist to finish, along with some daunting decisions
                  to be made on the way. In order to make the process easier, it
                  helps to have an idea of what universities look for when
                  judging applications. Post graduate applications are mostly
                  critically judged on the apparent (from the application)
                  capability of the candidate to conduct research over the next
                  few years, much more so for PhD applications than MS
                  applications. They use several metrics to judge this, and
                  putting together all they want forms a majority of the journey
                  of applying to grad school. <br /><br />

                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Starting in early August, I discovered I had a lot to
                  accomplish in the next few months! I had to take the GRE and
                  the TOEFL, put together all the documents required for filling
                  out the applications, write the dreaded SOPs, obtain the
                  letters of recommendation, scout out the universities where my
                  research interests were good fits, fill out the application
                  forms, all the while managing academics and under-graduate
                  project work. So I divided my application process into two
                  halves.<br /><br />

                  The first half, from the start of August to the end of
                  September, was focused on the GRE and TOEFL and preparing all
                  required documents like CV, passport and the like. Then, like
                  some others, I was nervous about the GRE. Although I had a
                  pretty strong background in English, speaking mostly English
                  at home as I grew up, the last time I read a non-academic
                  English text was seven years ago, and this showed in my verbal
                  practice test scores. So I put in some focused effort on the
                  verbal sections over the next two months, which of course
                  included vocabulary building as well. A couple of points about
                  the GRE for prospective test takers: first, the time needed to
                  prepare for the GRE is a subjective matter, and for
                  engineering students, it depends mostly on your confidence in
                  your facility with English. I managed in two months (they were
                  semester months with little free time), but the best way to
                  judge for yourself is to take a practice test (legitimately,
                  in one go, under near identical test conditions without any
                  fraud) and see where you stand. Secondly, the importance of
                  the GRE is gradually diminishing, with universities mostly
                  using it as a filtration criteria. It never hurts to have your
                  GRE score as high as possible, but usually a 325-330 with an
                  AWA of 4.5 is more than enough for any target university you
                  may have. As for the TOEFL, I only prepared for two-three days
                  using YouTube, but it again depends on your facility with the
                  usage of English in everyday situations.<br /><br />

                  After getting satisfactory scores on the tests, and after
                  spending hours getting the relevant documents ready, I was in
                  early October. It was time to write the SOPs. One essentially
                  has up to two pages to sell himself/herself, appearing
                  confident but not proud, appearing open to different ideas the
                  culture of the university has to offer while also projecting a
                  clear idea of what he/she would like to accomplish during
                  his/her stay there, and maybe even after that. Naturally, the
                  SOP for each university should be unique (to be effective),
                  although one may follow similar trains of thought throughout
                  the essay for all of them. It took a month of effort, and
                  several drafts, modified with feedback from people from
                  several different walks of life, to get the SOPs ready.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />

                  The final step was filling the massive application forms, and
                  getting the letters of recommendation. Usually one is required
                  to submit up to three LORs, though certain universities allow
                  submission of up to six. Two of my LORs were from my research
                  mentors, and the third from a course instructor, whose course
                  I did well in. LORs were probably the most important part of
                  my application, since I did not have a publication at the time
                  of submitting my application forms. It is important to ask for
                  your LORs at least a month before the deadlines for
                  applications, which usually begin in December. Professors are
                  extremely busy people, and it is in the applicant’s interest
                  to make the process of writing the letters as easy as possible
                  for them, so that they get enough time to ponder on and write
                  strong letters. It also always helps to, while asking for the
                  letters, submit a summary of coursework and project-work done
                  with them. While on internship, towards the end of the
                  internship I very carefully documented everything I did during
                  the internship, and the goals that were met. It gave my
                  recommenders more material and jogged their memory about what
                  I did with them. As a student, one does not usually control
                  this part of the application, both the content of the letters
                  and when they are submitted. Some of my letters were submitted
                  uncomfortably close to the deadline, which made me rather
                  queasy as a stickler for deadlines!<br /><br />

                  And I was done! A semester long journey ended (thankfully),
                  and it was time to cool my heels and wait for the results. The
                  letters came in starting January all the way to April, and the
                  wait during that period was, admittedly, pretty heart
                  wrenching. I got my fair share of admits and rejects, from
                  both MS and PhD applications, and was fortunate enough to be
                  admitted to some of my top choices. Making the final choice
                  between schools is always a phenomenally difficult decision,
                  and was no different for me. In the end, it is just about
                  making the most informed, objective and guided choice. As a
                  result, I find myself heading to Stanford University to pursue
                  my graduate studies.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />

                  As I wrote this article, the consequentiality of the journey
                  that I have undertaken, and the enormity of what is still to
                  come, struck me. Although this blog only covered my journey of
                  the application process,the truth is that everything one does
                  from day one at IIT Kanpur, plays a role in where one will
                  eventually go, more so for graduate school than anything else.
                  When I entered IITK, I was already pretty motivated and
                  willing to go any distance to do well at whatever I did. What
                  I realize at the end of my journey, however, is that more than
                  my individual determination, it was the brilliance and
                  discipline of the people around me that drove me the most. I
                  count myself as very fortunate to have had people to guide me,
                  motivate me and give me chances when I needed them the most,
                  not just in academics but in all aspects of my life.<br /><br />

                  To conclude, I would add that the world of research and
                  graduate school I have seen so far, is different from the
                  classical rat race we in India are so used to running: there
                  is no blueprint for how things are supposed to happen, and no
                  set path to guarantee victory or success. Both enjoyment and
                  success indeed depend on how much you enjoy wrestling with
                  problems, obstacles and challenges on a daily basis!
