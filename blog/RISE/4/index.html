                <p>
                  Hello! So..welcome to third year. It's the year with probably
                  maximum opportunities and the one where most of us go through
                  maximum confusion. There are so many possibilities, limited
                  time and it becomes tough at times to decide what to
                  prioritize over what. For me, it was the time around which I
                  started to develop a liking for my discipline - BSBE and
                  decided to give it a solid shot before graduation so that if
                  in future I do end up switching fields and end up with
                  something completely different as a career option, I would
                  have the satisfaction of exploring my major first. Hence, like
                  most of the students at this point of their college life, I
                  decided to go for a research internship during my third year
                  summers. Having absolutely zero research experience, it became
                  essential for me to join a lab to gain a better understanding
                  of the subject as well as understand the nuances of research.
                  I felt the purpose would be better served for me, if there was
                  a formal evaluation at the end of it and thus I opted for
                  credited UGPs in both my 5th & 6th semester. This works
                  differently for everyone I believe, while for some formal
                  evaluation may improve their performance or ensure they follow
                  deadlines other people may do better without this additional
                  pressure and pursue the subject out of their own personal
                  motivation. <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />

                  Now coming to the actual process of looking for an internship.
                  Again, I would like to emphasize that these are my personal
                  views and experiences and could be very varied for everyone.
                  So, I started by talking to seniors to figure out the entire
                  process and researching the various options available. The
                  realization I came to was that the opportunities offered
                  through the institute usually had a very strict evaluation
                  criteria. Hence, one would have to look for opportunities
                  externally and apply independently extensively. This is not to
                  say that I didn’t look at applying to the standard programs,
                  though I did it very half heartedly. Here I would like to
                  mention that it was a mistake on my part which I realized
                  later. One should give their best to all applications and even
                  apply to the most prestigious programs, even if you feel you
                  don’t stand a decent shot, because we never realize what might
                  just work out. A thing which comes in handy with the
                  application procedure, and may be pretty exhausting at times
                  is to identify professors beforehand, at least two, who would
                  be willing to recommend you and have a conversation about your
                  plans well in advance, preferably at the beginning of the 5 th
                  semester itself. Additionally, working on a write up about
                  your research interests, your journey so far and your future
                  plans can reduce the time you will take while applying later.
                  <br /><br />

                  The most daunting and toughest part of finding a research
                  internship, for me, was the part about ‘apping’’. This is the
                  part where one looks independently for professors across
                  various universities abroad and writes to them seeking an
                  opportunity to intern in their lab in the summers. The mail
                  will typically have one’s resume and a cover letter or
                  something along the lines of an SOP attached. Because of the
                  nature of the process, the success rate is usually very low
                  and it can be a really challenging phase for one. It was for
                  me for sure. It made me doubt my own capabilities, there were
                  times when I didn’t feel like talking to anyone, went in
                  isolation and would begin to question the entire point of me
                  pursuing engineering even. I was not even sure who could I
                  approach at that time and it begins to get even worse when a
                  lot of your batch mates have already secured internships and
                  you’re still looking for one as the academic year draws to an
                  end, as was in my case. What really did get me through was the
                  support from family and friends, and realizing that this is
                  just one small part of a jigsaw puzzle in the larger scheme of
                  things. Also, I am a firm believer of the fact that everything
                  happens for a reason and things have a way of falling into
                  place eventually. <br /><br />

                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  It does help to identify a group of friends who are also
                  looking for internships and are applying. It can be a place
                  where you can share your frustration with like minded people
                  and also encourage each other. The one thing I did not
                  compromise on during the entire process was my own integrity
                  or that of the institute by mass mailing or running a script,
                  which is something I believe we should all be mindful of.
                  Also, I believe that the work done on an internship is always
                  more valuable than where it is carried out, hence it doesn’t
                  make sense to go to a lab which may not have a project of your
                  interest just because it is an opportunity outside India.
                  Moreover, the lab should preferably be a ‘better’ lab than the
                  lab you’re currently associated with. It wouldn’t make sense
                  to go to a place which has a publication record not comparable
                  to the current lab. These were some of my beliefs during the
                  entire process.<br /><br />

                  The actual process of ‘apping’ also tends to get interesting
                  once you do end up finding a professor who may be interested
                  in hiring you. Then comes the tricky part of negotiating the
                  terms and funding to figure out what works for you. It can
                  also be the time where one may feel that you may have finally
                  secured an intern and yet it may not work out in the end.
                  Patience is probably the key throughout the entire process of
                  looking for an intern and not giving up. I would also strongly
                  suggest to keep all options that one has open right till the
                  end, i.e. to say do not stop writing to professors and
                  communicating with those who are interested right till the
                  point everything for your first preference has been finalized,
                  right till the point of securing the visa.<br /><br />

                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />

                  I had a great time interning in Singapore and was very lucky
                  to have extremely helpful and friendly lab mates. The
                  environment was warm and welcoming, with quite a few team
                  lunches as well. Overall living in a new country all by
                  yourself gives a sense of independence like no other. It is
                  important in opening our eyes to various cultures across the
                  world and finding our own way in that world. Every person we
                  meet along the way has a story to share and every story adds
                  to one’s perspective I believe.
                  <br /><br />Overall it can be quite an interesting experience
                  looking for a research intern and definitely one that will
                  make you wiser along the way. Always remember your worth and
                  have confidence in yourself as well as in the process. Good
                  Luck!
                </p>
