                  In the eighth article of the blog series
                  <strong>Pranav Kulkarni</strong>, an undergraduate student in
                  the Department of Mechanical Engineering from the Y15 batch
                  shares his experience with application procedure to graduate
                  schools in Europe before he finally got admitted to “Aalto
                  University” for his graduate studies.<br /><br />

                    >Aalto university is one of IITK MOUs, composed of six
                    schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff
                    members, making it Finland's second largest university. The
                    main campus of Aalto University is located in Otaniemi,

                  As I entered L13, a little later than the stipulated time, I
                  saw numerous eager faces occupying not just all the chairs but
                  also the floor to listen to how to get a good Masters or PhD
                  position after graduation. This was a session organised by the
                  AnC to help students get acquainted with the application
                  process for higher education, and I was one of the speakers.
                  Having reached late, I was to speak to the audience at the
                  end, and upon listening to the experiences of my fellow
                  speakers, I realised how different my path had been as
                  compared to theirs. This article is just an attempt to ensure
                  that those who take the same road as mine don't feel that not
                  being able to achieve something is the end of the world. Trust
                  me, it's not. :)
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  First of all, let me introduce myself. I, Pranav Kulkarni, am
                  an alumnus (feels proud to say this :P) of the Department of
                  Mechanical Engineering, IITK. I will be pursuing my Masters in
                  Mechanical Engineering from Aalto University in Finland
                  starting September 2019.
                  <br /><br />

                  I believe that if one has a strong reason to reach a goal, no
                  matter how many obstacles hinder the path, one will get
                  through them eventually. I am well aware that this is not
                  supposed to be a motivational article but the aforementioned
                  statement sums my journey from IITK to Aalto. Before I tell
                  you why it was so, let me outline the application process when
                  it comes to the European Universities. Although Devansh
                  Saraswat's blog talks about the application process for the
                  United States' universities, most of the elements are similar
                  when it comes to applying to European universities. However,
                  there are certain differences:
                  <br /><br />
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The GRE is more relevant when it comes to applying in the US
                    but it's not so in Europe. However, there are some
                    universities (exceptions) which require GRE scores. Most
                    European universities will be satisfied only with your
                    English Language scores (tests like TOEFL, IELTS, CAE etc).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Most European universities will ask you to send hard copies
                    of the documents that you have submitted online. Further,
                    some universities may not even take the documents through
                    their portal but ask you to send hard copies to them with a
                    copy of the online application form. Also, they will require
                    a sealed copy of your transcripts which you can get from
                    DOAA for 100 rupees per copy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Tuition fees in European universities is substantially less
                    as compared to their American counterparts. For me, this was
                    an important point to consider. Additionally, many programs
                    in German universities are tuition free.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provided you have a decent academic record and a decent
                    profile of research/industry projects, there is a high
                    chance that you will be awarded scholarships which could
                    vary from as little as 2000 EUR per semester to a 100%
                    tuition fee waiver. However, this probability is far less in
                    American universities even when you have an excellent
                    profile (this might be my bias, but I am writing through my
                    experiences and from the experiences of my peers)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Also, application deadlines for some European universities
                    are as late as May 31st (German universities especially).
                    That means, you would have already applied to American
                    universities by that time and would have surplus time to
                    apply in Europe. (For universities which have deadlines in
                    or after January, you have the option to submit your
                    transcripts until the sixth or seventh semester. As was the
                    case with me, I had improved my CPI at the end of seventh
                    semester and had received the transcripts near the end of
                    December for further applications.)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />

                  Now let me tell you how I ended up deciding to go to Aalto. It
                  was the summer after the sixth semester and I was interning at
                  a company in Pune. I was really interested in the work that
                  the company did, however the projects assigned to me did not
                  interest me at all. I met a fellow intern from IITR and he was
                  working on a different project. As we shared our experience
                  during daily breaks, he informed me that the software which
                  the company was selling (and he was using) kept violating
                  several fundamental physical laws (for example, mass balance
                  in chemical reactions). Further, the software I was working on
                  did not give consistent results for the same system
                  parameters. I was pretty bummed by this and was also
                  uncomfortable in the work environment. I knew I was interested
                  in research but I had never given it a serious thought. The
                  intern experience pretty much confirmed to me that a higher
                  education was necessary. However, I was not ready for
                  committing five years to research right away considering I did
                  not have a research experience of more than 3 months. Thereby
                  to get a gist of research, a master's was an ideal option for
                  me. I did consider converting into a dual degree but upon
                  talking with a few seniors and a few professors, going abroad
                  seemed to be a better option. Also, the professor I wanted to
                  work with, had I converted to dual, was already taken by my
                  batch mates as their supervisor.
                  <br /><br />

                  And thus, even before my internship ended, I started to
                  shortlist universities. I went through the QS rankings and
                  focussed mainly on European universities. However, I also
                  shortlisted some American universities which had a program of
                  my interest. I went as low as 150 because there were fewer
                  universities from Europe in that list. I almost had a rough
                  data of about 60 universities after which I added the
                  selection criteria for these universities to this data. Apart
                  from what I've already mentioned above, here are some
                  interesting facts:
                  <br /><br />
                </p>

                <li>
                  Universities in Australia will generally not require the
                  English language test scores as long as you submit an attested
                  document confirming that your undergraduate education was
                  primarily in English. Some of these universities won't even
                  ask you for GRE scores.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Universities in Germany will usually need you to take a test
                  or might ask for GATE scores. However, GATE requirement is
                  usually waived off for IIT graduates. Also, they give
                  significant importance to work experience so it might be
                  difficult to get in. Although, I have encountered quite a few
                  exceptions to this criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Universities in the UK have a lower CPI cutoff for IIT
                  graduates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Universities in Sweden do not have individual application
                  portal. Instead they have a centralised system where you have
                  to list your preference for the university and programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Universities like ETH Zürich will only accept you if you are
                  in the top 10% of your batch. You'll probably need to show
                  some proof of this like the Academic Excellence award for
                  example. However, other criteria like résumé, SOP, test scores
                  etc are also important. and so on…
                </li>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                  This list is pretty much endless but since the aforementioned
                  countries could be popular destinations, I thought it would be
                  a good idea to mention here.

                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />

                  I now decided to give the TOEFL and GRE towards the end of
                  August and the first week of September respectively. I did
                  have the option of giving the exams on consecutive days, but I
                  felt that giving the TOEFL earlier would give me a good boost
                  of confidence and I knew both these exams were pretty tiring.
                  I prepared for the GRE verbal through the Magoosh GRE
                  Flashcards app, and gave a few mock tests available online and
                  also those which one gets upon registering for the exam. I
                  prepared for the TOEFL through a book by Princeton review
                  (Cracking the TOEFL iBT). Although it was an expensive
                  purchase, I felt it was important for me considering how
                  little knowledge I had about their grading policies. It gave
                  me a really good idea as to what was expected and needless to
                  say, I did get a satisfactory result. Also, I am well aware
                  that most will consider the GRE quant to be very easy, I'd
                  suggest you to practice it. A friend of mine, did not even see
                  the kind of questions he'd be facing apart from the mock tests
                  he gave and ended up scoring just about 150 something in
                  quant. In short, don't be overconfident about the quant
                  section.
                  <br /><br />

                  After this, I started working on the SOP. I must've written
                  like 6 or 7 drafts before finalising my essay. So don't bother
                  too much if you don't end up with a perfect SOP in your very
                  first attempt. I had to proofread the essay from about 3-4
                  people. Here I'd like to add, don't ask too many people to
                  proofread your SOP. You'll probably end up getting confused
                  over the suggestions from too many people. Just ask a handful
                  of people who are good in English and who are acquainted with
                  you as a person. Also, PLEASE refrain from getting someone
                  else to write your SOP as this is not only a malpractice but
                  it also will never show your true self to the university. It
                  would also be a good idea to mention the name and work of a
                  few professors with whom you'd like to work. That is, make
                  every SOP specific to the university you're applying.
                  <br /><br />

                  I met with a very interesting situation during the application
                  to Aalto. Two days before the deadline, I found that I was
                  supposed to send hard copies to the university but since it
                  would've taken about 4-5 days for the documents to reach the
                  university, I had almost given up on applying. Fortunately, I
                  found an acquaintance studying in Aalto who agreed to deliver
                  my documents to the university. It was indeed a fortuitous
                  episode, considering I will be studying there for the next
                  couple of years. I was more inclined towards European
                  universities because I did not want to burden myself with a
                  debt. Working after graduation to repay the loan did not seem
                  like a good idea. Having said that, I had to reject the admits
                  from CMU, University of Amsterdam and Imperial College London.
                  Although these universities were far better in ranking as
                  compared to Aalto, I did not want to be a burden on my family,
                  financially. I believe that moving out of your comfort zone is
                  the only way towards personal growth and I had already made up
                  my mind to study and earn independently.
                  <br /><br />

                  Amidst all this, I was also appearing for placements and
                  planning on giving the CAT on the insistence of my parents. On
                  day 7 of the placement drive, I was placed in L&T and I also
                  obtained a satisfactory CAT percentile thus a call from IIM
                  Indore. Since I was hell bent on going for Master's, I had to
                  talk it out with my parents who wanted their son to be an
                  IIT-IIM graduate. Although it seemed difficult at first, they
                  finally agreed to let me study abroad.

                  Nitik had asked me to write this article towards the end of
                  May. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances I could not
                  write this that time. Nevertheless, it's better late than
                  never and as long as this blog is, I hope it was helpful to at
                  least some of you. I would like to end by saying that one
                  should never be afraid of following their heart no matter how
                  difficult things might get, your heart will guide you through
                  all the difficulties! All the very best! You can reach out to
                  me on Facebook, or email me at
                  <strong>pskulk6497@gmail.com</strong>. We can talk more on
                  this and I am always up for a discussion on life ;)
                  <br /><br />Thank you! :)
