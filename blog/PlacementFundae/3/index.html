                  Hi, I am <strong>Aditya Lakhe</strong>, a Y15 graduate who sat
                  through the placement season. This blog is for some useful
                  tips and tricks to ease the tension during placements.

                <p>
                  Hey guys and gals!!! Welcome to the most hectic and stressful
                  phase of your campus life-the much dreaded ‘placements’. In
                  case you feel you are somewhat lacking in your preparations,
                  stay calm and have faith in yourself. Many students are
                  unclear about the kind of job they want. Talk to different
                  alumni, seniors, and friends, who have had different job
                  profiles to get insights into each domain. You should have a
                  proper understanding of the skills required in each field and
                  decide what suits you best accordingly. Keep honing your
                  aptitude and coding skills through regular practice from
                  various resources like pariksha.com, SPO preparation portal,
                  etc. My friends and I used to practice guesstimates, case
                  studies, and puzzles in groups to create a mock interview kind
                  of an environment. It is certainly going to increase your
                  self-confidence and be beneficial in the actual interview.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float:left"
                  />
                  The most important part of your preparation is your resume.
                  Your resume should be honest and to the point because a lot of
                  time would be dedicated to verifying the points mentioned in
                  your resume, especially in the HR round. You should be able to
                  counter every possible argument that can be made about the
                  points in your resume. While drafting your resume, get it
                  verified by as many alumni, seniors, and friends as you can,
                  from different backgrounds and experiences to get different
                  perspectives. Always remember however much your resume sounds
                  perfect to you, it is another’s perspective that is gonna
                  decide your future. Once satisfied with the final draft of
                  your resume, ask your peers and seniors to take a mock
                  interview of yours based on that resume. Making a resume
                  should be an iterative process, that ought to make perfect.
                  Consult as many people possible and select the best fit for
                  you:) <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float:right"
                  />
                  CGPA is undoubtedly one of the most crucial aspects of your
                  resume as it is, in some sense, a quantitative measure of your
                  academic life in college. But let me be clear, it is not the
                  only selection criteria. Once you get an interview, if you are
                  relevant for the job profile, no matter what your CGPA is, you
                  will get selected if you have prepared well for the interview.
                  If you can prove to the interviewer that you have the required
                  skills and personality, the CGPA won’t matter much. So if you
                  have a low CGPA just as I had, don't worry because there's
                  little you can do about it now, instead try to focus on your
                  other skills and prepare well for the interview. Some of the
                  companies do have a strict CGPA criterion even after selection
                  and might reject you even if you have the relevant skills,
                  which happened with my friend, but this is the case with only
                  a few companies. Most of the companies are just searching for
                  a person most suitable for the job. That friend of mine, who
                  got rejected due to his CGPA was placed the very next day in
                  ICICI Lombard. CGPA might be a significant criterion during
                  placement season, but once you get into the interview room, it
                  is only your skills that matter the most. Don’t get stressed
                  about your CGPA or any such stuff now. Prepare well for the
                  interview because now that’s what gonna matter the most and
                  have a blast on the final interview day!!!<br /><br />

                  One thing people having low CGPA usually bother about the most
                  is getting the reason behind their low CGPA asked in the
                  interview room. Don’t get nervous. Prepare well for this
                  question from before and be confident while answering. In most
                  cases it is the student's fault for the low CGPA, so be honest
                  and let them know that it was your fault in the first place.
                  Definitely tell them how passionate you are about the job and
                  that this failure isn't going to stop you from achieving what
                  you want to accomplish in your career or life in general.
                  Also, it may be the case that you would have excelled in
                  various other things on the campus like sports, leadership
                  positions, cultural activities, etc. Let them know about these
                  things, but never make it sound like an excuse for your low
                  CGPA. Tell them that you have learned a lot from this one
                  failure and it has made you realize the importance of
                  consistency and dedication in life, thus making you more
                  determined to work hard in your career.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"

                  />
                  Placement seasons are going to be a test for your patience
                  well. Getting rejected in many interviews could also make you
                  question yourself "Will I get placed or not?" but trust me if
                  you stay patient and have faith in your skills, you will
                  definitely get placed. During my placement days after getting
                  rejected in a lot of interviews, I started losing faith. The
                  question of getting placed started coming up in my mind and I
                  sort of started giving up, but my friends kept supporting me.
                  In one of my interviews, I was unable to answer the technical
                  questions, which I knew was due to undue stress. I was so low
                  in confidence that the thought of having to tell the
                  interviewer every specific detail of the questions that he/she
                  was asking made me not answer them. When I shared this
                  experience with one of my friends, she helped me regain my
                  faith and told me that I knew all these things. Her talking to
                  me made me realize that I just had to inform them about my
                  skills. It is not about answering the questions in a very
                  detailed manner. Instead, it's about letting them know as much
                  as you know about that specific job profile. What I have
                  learned after so many interviews is that it is necessary to
                  think out loud during the interviews and thus convey to the
                  interviewer as much as you can. Think of it as a conversation
                  about the relevant skills and not an interview. Also, quite
                  importantly, stay with your friends during the placement
                  season as they will prove to be a massive support system for
                  you during this stressful period. Even after you are placed,
                  help your friends as much as you can. Be patient, it’s just a
                  matter of time. <br /><br />Good luck to everyone for their
                  future endeavors.Cheers!!
