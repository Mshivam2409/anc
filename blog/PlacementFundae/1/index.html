                  Hello everyone,<br />
                  Hope you guys had a lit Antaragni.<br /><br />

                  I am <strong>Deepak Lunawat</strong> and I have graduated this
                  year as a B. Tech from the Department of Civil Engineering,
                  IIT Kanpur. Post-Antaragni is one of the most unexciting times
                  of the year and worst for those who sit for placements. I
                  believe you're having a very tight schedule of PPTs and tests.
                  As I've recently gone through the placement process, I can
                  feel the present aura of the campus. I know you all are
                  working hard but I'm sure there are many who are facing
                  problems due to poor academic performance. As I have been on
                  the same situation, I feel I should share my experience and
                  some fundas which might help you to overcome this hindrance
                  and get the best out of it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When I submitted my final CV with a CPI of 5.6, the only
                  option I had was to make other sections strong to balance this
                  gap. First I did an online Coursera project based on Data
                  Science and Machine Learning. Completion of that project
                  boosted my confidence and I started working on my aptitude. To
                  build up communication skills I started reading newspapers and
                  articles. We used to prepare for guesstimates and case studies
                  in groups. There have been times when all of this seemed
                  useless because of my poor academics, but my self-confidence
                  and support from my family and friends kept me from giving up.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  Having gone through the placement process, I would say every
                  achievement has its importance and value, be it in academics
                  or extracurriculars. For instance, consulting companies look
                  for PORs, good internships, and decent CPI. Coding companies
                  mostly test only coding skills. Core companies look for
                  domain-specific knowledge and related projects. Non-core
                  companies have demands according to their work profile.
                  However, CPI is the most crucial segment of your CV,
                  irrespective of the field you choose. A good CPI is indicative
                  of your dedication and consistency. As is commonly said, a
                  good CPI might not guarantee you a job, but it certainly makes
                  your path to the interview room relatively easier.’ Why do you
                  have a low CGPA?’ is a very common question if your academics
                  have not been very well. My advice is to play it very safely.
                  Neither get nervous nor give unnecessary excuses as it creates
                  a dull impression. Tell them clearly that your CPI is low
                  because you did not study properly in the first place and not
                  a day goes by in the last semester when you have not regretted
                  that. Gently admit that although you may have been on
                  leadership roles or in extracurriculars, but in college
                  studying is the one thing that is supposed to be done, so
                  there is no alternative explanation to this. But also ensure
                  them that you are highly passionate about undoing it, working
                  very hard and never felt this energetic before because of that
                  one failure. By this, you show them that you have an attitude
                  of accepting failures and working hard on them, the
                  much-needed skill in the corporate world. For me ‘Low CPI’ is
                  one failure that will always keep me on my toes and drive a
                  sense of sincerity and discipline in me.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Your CV is the reflection of what you have done in your life
                  till now, hence it is important to put it in the right way.
                  For the ones whose academics are not strong, don’t get
                  depressed. CPI just takes a seed size space on your full page
                  resume. Each one of you must have devoted your 3 years in many
                  different activities, learned many productive skills. Write
                  everything in a systematic manner. Put more emphasis on
                  writing valued work rather than filling it with unnecessary
                  stuff for the sake of filling the space. Avoid exaggerated
                  statements, complex wordings, grammatical errors and informal
                  language. And most importantly, your CV should reflect the
                  real you, never ever lie on your CV.
                  <br /><br />
                  Now comes the final interview after all is done. I got placed
                  on the 8th of December and those were the most traumatic 8
                  days of my life. I would not have been able to cope up with
                  that, had my wingmates not been there to support me.
                  <br /><br />
                  Because of my low CPI and fear of coding, my scope of
                  companies was very limited. Out of the numerous companies I
                  had applied to, I got my first interview on Day 4.
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong
                    >Day-4, Company- L & T infotech, Profile- Business
                    Analyst</strong
                  ><br />
                  Following a GD, there was a 45 min technical round, completely
                  based on Machine Learning and Algorithms. As I had recently
                  completed a project on ML and grasped all the concepts, I
                  cracked that interview. I got selected, had an offer letter in
                  my hand and then HR realized that they can’t recruit
                  candidates whose CPI is below 6. Hence, rejected. I requested
                  them a lot, cried in front of them, but all came to nothing.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  <strong
                    >Day-5, Company- ZS Associates, profile - Business
                    Associate</strong
                  ><br />
                  It had 1 Case-study round-1 hr written case study, 1 technical
                  round-basic questions on analytics, ML and 1 HR round-mostly
                  resume based with some puzzles and guesstimates. After
                  clearing all three, ideally I must get selected but due to low
                  CPI, I got rejected, after getting selected, for the 2nd time.
                  <br /><br />
                  As the major share of companies coming to campus placements
                  require good coding skills, I had a tough time to get inside
                  the interview room.
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong
                    >Day-8, Company ICICI Lombard, profile - Manager</strong
                  ><br />
                  After clearing the aptitude test, it had 2 technical rounds,
                  questions majorly based on my resume and my POR. That's why
                  you must have a complete understanding of every single word
                  you have written in your resume. After that, it had one HR
                  round, very generic questions were asked about the company,
                  your aspirations, your expectations, etc. After day-long
                  sessions of interviews, this time, I finally got recruited as
                  a Manager in ICICI Lombard where I am working right now. I
                  still remember each and every moment of that night. The
                  feeling of getting placed will make all your efforts, your
                  sacrifices, your rejections worth it.
                  <br /><br />
                  One of the most difficult parts of the placements is handling
                  the stress without losing one’s cool. Undoubtedly, the 7th/9th
                  semester is the most stressful time for anyone who is sitting
                  for placements. From PPTs (in formals) to company tests(Even
                  during Antaragni), and with your regular semester load, your
                  schedule will be jam-packed.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image4.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  Keep your course load as low as possible this semester. Prefer
                  not to take any heavy project, unless it is very important or
                  relevant to your preparations, as it will consume a lot of
                  time which otherwise could be used on developing skills. For
                  case-study and guesstimates, always prepare in a group. It
                  helps in creating the mock environment and will give a much
                  needed moral support in the low time. And most importantly, Be
                  focused. Don’t get distracted from what friends/seniors/alums
                  are saying regarding your low CPI. If you are genuinely
                  working hard and have patience, you will get placed. Period.
                  <br /><br />
                  Just in case, if your skill sets do not resonate with any
                  company’s and you remain unplaced in phase I, don’t get
                  disheartened. Many students in my batch got placed in phase 2
                  with good company and high package, and very honestly, this is
                  not even your beginning. Life is full of opportunities, much
                  more than we could ever imagine. Learn from your failures and
                  come stronger.
                  <br /><br />
                  To those who are not sitting for placements, be there for your
                  friends. Go with them during interviews. They will need your
                  support and encouragement.
                  <br /><br />
                  You can reach me out for any kind of help, anytime. All the
                  best!
