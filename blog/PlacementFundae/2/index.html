                  Hey. I am <strong>Akash Jain</strong> and somehow completed my
                  bachelors from Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT
                  Kanpur. If you have not planned yet and waiting for Day 1 to
                  knock, do give this a read. I have listed a few ways to
                  approach the season smartly and bring out the best from it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Hello guys!! Hope you are doing well. I am Akash Jain, a 2019
                  pass out from the department of aerospace engineering.
                  Currently, I am working as a software engineer in Societe
                  Generale.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  As the placement season is approaching, I would like to share
                  my experience and some points to help you through the
                  placements. Firstly I would say you have to play smart and
                  strategize well. To start with, it is the resume. You should
                  get your resume reviewed by people from different domains,
                  having different interests and expertise. Once your resume is
                  done then comes shortlisting companies. Choose companies you
                  would like to apply to but be careful not to apply to
                  companies way out of your league or on the bottom side. Keep
                  in mind the selection criterion of the company and whether you
                  meet the requirements like CPI cutoff and other such necessary
                  stuff. While selecting keep in mind the profile you are
                  applying for and consider if you have some background or
                  expertise in that field. Consult your seniors while making the
                  list as they are the best ones to guide you. I would suggest
                  you make 3 lists, the best-case scenario, the average case,
                  and the worst-case, but make sure these are the companies you
                  would be happy to go if you are selected. Above the best
                  criteria, you may apply or you may leave them. In case you are
                  certain you won’t get shortlisted for the big firms, just
                  leave them. Again guys, don’t get stressed unnecessarily
                  seeing people around you getting selected in those companies.
                  Peer pressure can lower your self-confidence. Be patient:)
                  <br /><br />
                  It’s not like your best case scenario companies will come
                  first, then the average case followed by your worst case. Your
                  worst-case scenario company might come on Day 1 slot and your
                  best scenario company might come on Day 3.You have to decide
                  based on your chances and your preparation level. Get a rough
                  idea of the Days and slots of the companies. In case you
                  decide you don’t want to go to a company, don’t apply for it.
                  It might also happen that you did not apply for your
                  worst-case scenario on Day 1 and you get rejected by your best
                  case scenario on Day 2. So always keep a backup for yourself.
                  Optimize companies according to your preferences.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  Coming to the companies in your best-case scenario, give the
                  highest priority to these companies. While shortlisting also
                  categorize based on the type of the company, like core or
                  non-core, software development profile or business analyst
                  profile, as each profile will require a different kind of
                  preparation. Prepare hard for best-case scenarios such that
                  you also cover your average and worst-case scenarios as your
                  best companies would require you to prepare hardest. Get to
                  know the tests, requirements, the company’s selection process,
                  interview rounds. You should go through the SPO preparation
                  portal and try contacting seniors who have gone through the
                  company’s selection process. Once you get an idea of what the
                  company’s demands are, prepare accordingly.
                  <br /><br />
                  Now comes the question from where to prepare for the
                  interview. In almost all of my interviews, the resume was
                  thoroughly verified. Be careful about what you write. Whenever
                  you go for an interview, you have to prepare an introduction.
                  You can give an overview of the things already mentioned in
                  your resume or mention your other achievements, maybe in
                  extracurriculars. The interviewer can select something from
                  your resume he finds interesting. They are usually catchy
                  about the numbers and figures in your resume. Puzzles are also
                  asked in interviews. There are some popular sites for
                  puzzle-solving and they can ask questions directly from these
                  websites. Here’s a trick for you guys!! Even if you have
                  solved the question before, take some time to think about it
                  and most importantly talk to the interviewer about your
                  approach. Talking to the interviewer shows that you have good
                  communication skills and you are a team person. For the HR
                  round, I would suggest you document something so that you have
                  a list of the HR questions and the answers to the questions.
                  You won’t be able to concentrate well just before the
                  interview as there will be a lot of things going on in your
                  mind at that time and you won’t be able to say all that you
                  want to in that stressful situation. Another thing usually
                  asked in business analyst and consulting profiles are
                  guesstimates which can be practiced from various online
                  platforms. For GDs as well, go through online resources, see
                  few GDs and the tricks involved, they do work actually. In one
                  of the GDs, the interviewers were noting down the names of the
                  candidates who spoke first. So one of the tips for GDs is to
                  speak first. For technical rounds, talk to your seniors and go
                  through the job description. Some companies may ask the
                  questions asked by bigger firms in their own rounds. Except
                  the Day 1 and Day 2 companies, most of the companies ask
                  questions asked by the bigger firms in their previous
                  interviews. Don’t leave those companies thinking that the
                  questions will be very complex. You stand a good chance!!

                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  The part people bother about the most is undoubtedly CPI and
                  more so in case it’s not up to the mark. Your academic
                  requirements will depend on the profile you are applying for.
                  So I would say don’t get too stressed, the CPI is just a
                  qualifying criterion. If you have CPI above the qualifying
                  criteria you will be treated equally as other candidates
                  having higher CPI than you in the interview. The CPI criterion
                  is different for different companies, some have it explicitly
                  mentioned while others might keep it open to all. Both CPI and
                  extracurriculars are valued by companies. A good CPI with
                  extracurriculars definitely gives you an edge over others. You
                  should have something other than your curriculum but if you
                  have done some good course projects you can also mention that
                  in your resume. Some companies would require you to have some
                  PoRs so that they can ensure you have the team spirit and
                  leadership skills needed for that profile. Questions like ‘Why
                  do you have a low CPI?’ can be asked in case your CPI is low.
                  Think of some way to justify it. You can use your
                  extracurricular achievements or other projects to justify it
                  but make sure you are able to handle the counter questions.
                  It’s all about facing their questions in a smart way such that
                  your low CPI does not give the interviewers a negative
                  impression of you. Again a good CPI just ensures that you will
                  definitely get an interview call but does not guarantee you
                  the offer letter. So whether your CPI is high or low, if you
                  have got the call you can be sure, you have equal chances as
                  anybody else. What solely matters is your preparation and
                  confidence level on the D-day and congrats!! you have that
                  dream job. Don’t get stressed because of your CPI and focus
                  solely on your performance in the interview. Always remember
                  you are not alone with the problems you face during the
                  placements which could be low CPI or anything else. You can
                  google to get answers to most of your problems but remember
                  there are both pros and cons to it. So it’s suggested to
                  select the answers suitable to your profile and get it
                  verified from your seniors.
                  <br /><br />
                  For students who are not sitting for placements this season,
                  your first task will be to check whether you have sufficient
                  material to fill up one page. In case you don’t have
                  sufficient material try for activities in different domains or
                  if you have some clarity about what field you want to go in
                  try to do some activities in that field. You can also go for
                  some activities that show a different personality trait of
                  yours. Team spirit is what many companies look for, so being
                  in some activity will add value to your resume. But again, I
                  would suggest that don’t do an activity just to fill in your
                  resume. The interviewer can see the duration for which you
                  have been involved in an activity and is likely to judge your
                  consistency in case you have switched roles frequently. This
                  could suggest that you are going to leave the company in the
                  future which no recruiter wants.
                  <br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image4.png"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  I would pen down a few of my interview experiences so that
                  people can have some idea. In one of my interviews, somehow
                  the recruiter got an impression that I would go for an MBA in
                  the future and I was even asked directly. So it’s not only
                  important to answer the questions but also think from the
                  interviewer’s perspective. I did not like the job location and
                  type of work that would be given to me in another interview.
                  So after the 2nd round, I decided to back off. In the 4th
                  round, I told the interviewers that I was not interested so
                  they did not shortlist me. While interacting with the
                  interviewers in one of the rounds I chose a wrong data
                  structure. The interviewer explained to me the correct data
                  structure and asked me to approach the problem using that data
                  structure. Although I knew the data structure from before I
                  asked for some time to think and came up with the solution
                  which impressed the interviewer. In one of the GDs, I knew I
                  had to start the discussion but I somehow missed it. I could
                  see the person managing the GD write down the names of the
                  people who started the talk and I panicked. But I noted down
                  the important points others missed and spoke when I got the
                  chance. The duration one is speaking and the content matter in
                  a GD. I remember a guy who was speaking a lot in the GD didn’t
                  get selected. In another interview the interviewer was
                  shifting between topics very quickly like from hardware to
                  architecture to algorithms. He asked me whether I knew about
                  the topics before asking questions from them. So it’s always
                  recommended that you be honest if you don’t know some topics
                  otherwise it creates a very bad impression if you give a wrong
                  answer. Again when multiple people are good at a thing the
                  interviewer might look for something extra in you.
                  <br /><br />
                  I would conclude by saying that the placement season is going
                  to be very stressful. Whether you are sitting for placement or
                  not it will be very important for you. After Day 7 or 8, there
                  is a large gap between the number of students sitting for the
                  tests and those who are yet to be placed. Talk to people and
                  don’t get stressed unnecessarily. Try to find out areas where
                  you are lacking. Find some seniors who have the same resume as
                  yours and ask them how they approached the placement season.
                  Get to know everything from them as they can guide you the
                  best. I remember my seniors and wingmates were always there to
                  help. Be there for your friends and try to help them as much
                  as possible.

                  views are also invited in case somebody wants to add any more
                  points other than these. Wishing all of you good luck for your
                  future. Cheers!!
