              <p class="blog-intro">
        Samvit is currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering in the mechanical stream. He graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2017 with B.Tech. in Aerospace Engineering. During his stay at IITK, he was an active member and Coordinator of Quiz Club. He interned at ENSTA ParisTech during his 3rd summers.

			            </center>
			            I joined in the fall of 2017, right after completing my undergraduate studies. I worked as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in many courses and faced a lot of ups and downs in research. It can sometimes be easy, while it can be stressful at times (regular meetings, discussions, etc.) It’s always been interesting and NOT boring!

							<h5 style="color: #57b3ff">How was your experience at IITK? How has the “tough academic structure” and other opportunities on campus helped you in your journey? Where did you pursue your intern in 2nd and 3rd year at IITK? How was your experience? You may relate to how it helped in deciding about and finally, pursuing research.</h5>
			                <br />
			            </center>
			            My experience at IITK was excellent. I was a sincere student; attended almost all classes. I had exposure to Prof. Sanjay Mittal’s (CFD - Computational Fluid Dynamics) lab early on and in the summers, I worked as an assistant to an undergraduate student who also was an assistant to a PhD student. I have also worked on a final year project of another student. The atmosphere at the lab was quite relaxed and unencumbered. I did the standard set of courses in my 2nd year and in the following summer break, I completed the SURGE research internship. In the next summers, I did an internship in France. By the end of 3rd year, I appeared for GRE, Toefl; taking up these exams early on had an advantage. However, I believe that opting for a dual-degree is a better option before PhD as it provides you with research exposure.

			                <br />
			            </center>
			            The most significant research exposure that I received while on campus was in Prof. Sanjay Mittal’s lab. My main aim while in the lab was to learn as much as I can. The US has a kind of boss-employee relationship as opposed to a relaxed prof-student relationship in IITK, however, research is more collaborative in the US as compared to IITK.

			            </center>
			            While looking for labs to apply to, I looked at journals and wrote to people who published well in my field. I think writing to relevant people is quite important.

							<h5 style="color: #57b3ff">How do you compare the research culture at IITK as compared to that at Johns Hopkins University?</h5>
			                <br />
			            </center>
			            In Johns Hopkins, independent work is expected, research is more collaborative. It is more hierarchical as compared to Europe and there is more pressure in Johns Hopkins as a regular presentation of work is expected whereas, interaction with professors is more as compared to in IITK. France has a more collegial relationship, which is quite good. Coursework is pretty good in both institutes. I would suggest taking up courses that interest you.

			                <br />
			            </center>
			            Academic research in the US is more managerial and not that attractive, however, Indian research is less managerial. Industrial research is more job oriented which requires self-motivation. It is important not to get frustrated and keeping your interest alive. A dual degree is a better option as exposure to long term projects and defending the thesis will get you a lot of experience. Explore the domains that interest you. Give more time to your project. Interacting and talking to people is also important.

			            Aerospace domain mainly consists of control and dynamics, structures, propulsion and fluid dynamics. My future plans are either to work in a research lab or become a professor preferably in India. Both Academic and Industrial internships are quite good as well. As far as UG research culture is concerned, it is better in IITK. The prof-student relationship is better in IITK as compared to Johns Hopkins. PORs are hyped. It is important to focus on studies as well.
