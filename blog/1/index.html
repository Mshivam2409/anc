                <p class="blog-intro">
                  In the opening blog of this series,
                  <strong>Avi Gupta</strong>, an undergraduate Student in the
                  Department of Material Science and Engineering from the Y15
                  batch, has penned down his experiences of research intern in
                  Nanyang Technological University starting from his subtle urge
                  for a research intern to transforming into a more confident
                  individual after completing one. He was also a Core Team
                  member, in the Operations division at the Counselling Service.
                  Owing to his experiences he has chosen to pursue higher
                  studies(PhD) in the field of Bio-Engineering.<br /><br />
                  <em>
                    Nanyang Technological University is the second oldest public
                    autonomous research university of Singapore. One of the best
                    in the world, this university was ranked 12th in the World
                    and 3rd in Asia by QS World university ranking and is the
                    3rd best university in the world for Material Sciences in
                    particular.
                  </em>
                </p>

                <img src="img/cover.jpeg" class="blog-cover" />
                <p>
                  “Nahin maa, abhi tak kisi ka reply nahin aaya.” As I sat on
                  the stairs of the library, the somberness in this reiterating
                  expression overpowered my fear for MSE301’s end sem. This
                  thought of not getting an intern had been bothering me for a
                  while (rather an entire semester). Maybe this fear was going
                  to daunt me some more.<br /><br />

                  Before I dwell into the details of my internship experience, I
                  am Avi Gupta, *insert rhetorical educational status* and I
                  interned in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
                  People often ask me why I chose a research intern over an
                  industrial intern. If you think that I might provide you with
                  the key to figuring out whether research is the right fit for
                  you, you might be mistaken. Frankly speaking, even I don’t
                  know what made me so desperate for a research intern and turn
                  a blind eye towards the industrial one.<br /><br />

                  *Clichéd reasoning for research intern ahead. The reader is
                  advised to dwell further at his/her own risk*<br /><br />

                  <img
                    src="img/image2.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  I like to believe that I am a free individual and I deserve
                  the freedom to work on my own ideas, expand my knowledge base
                  in the domain of my academic interest, and the freedom to
                  choose my own time to go to work. Alternatively, I reckon that
                  maybe being born into a family of academicians, I was
                  hardwired to pursue higher studies after my under-graduation,
                  and a research intern seemed like the next logical step.
                  Having an interest in the field of Biomaterials and pursuing a
                  minor in “Tissue Engineering”, I decided to give one last shot
                  to research before I concluded whether ‘higher studies’ was
                  something I was willing to pursue.<br /><br />

                  For research internships, there are usually two alternatives –
                  programs from universities/governments/tie-ups or ‘apping’
                  (sending emails directly to professors). Since SPO does not
                  play a role in academic internships, I made the first mistake
                  that I would suggest none of you should repeat. Here is the
                  only rule of academic internships – “Always keep a backup
                  plan”. Do register yourself on the SPO portal and apply for
                  any internship that you ‘might’ be interested in. Touchwood,
                  if things do not work out as you might have planned, you will
                  at least have the experience of facing interviews and a backup
                  plan to revert upon. Start mailing professors from September
                  and yeah, most importantly, do brace yourself for
                  uncertainties.<br /><br />

                  Like every other academic internship aspirant, I too applied
                  to programs like MITACS, S N Bose, IJEP and NTU-India Connect.
                  You can log onto OIR’s website to take a look at the list of
                  available programs. If you ask me what improves your chances
                  of getting selected in a program, I will choose to exercise my
                  Right to Silence. I have seen departmental toppers getting
                  waitlisted in programs and people with just one research
                  project and a decent (not outstanding) CPI getting selected.
                  Since the results for applications came around
                  January/February, I had some hope for getting selected in at
                  least one of the programs until the end of the fifth semester.
                  How could I have known that this torture was not going to end
                  soon! Needless to say, since I was neither DR-1, nor did I
                  have an outstanding CPI, I wasn’t selected for any of the
                  programs.<br /><br />

                  My fifth semester ended on a rather lugubrious note. My
                  academics were not up to my expectations, and I was without an
                  intern while my friends gave treats for theirs. With a
                  somewhat preoccupied headspace, I started sending out emails
                  to professors firstly in February (which is rather late).
                  Trust me when I say this, receiving any reply from a
                  professor; acceptance or refusal; translated to an enthralling
                  experience. This was the 'only' time I refreshed my webmail
                  more times than my Facebook (I used to think so until last
                  semester. Brace yourselves for the results of college
                  applications for MS/PhD. It's even more tormenting!). I still
                  remember the day, 25th April 2018, I got an email from
                  Jacqueline with the subject – “TEP approval for Avi Gupta.” My
                  exhilaration was held back only by the immediate end-sem
                  affairs and due regard for others studying in the library.
                  Honestly, I do consider myself lucky to have secured an
                  internship in the 3rd best university for Materials Science in
                  the World, but this realisation did not hit me until I had
                  arrived in Singapore. I can’t help but highlight the plight of
                  the situation since as soon as my TEP arrived in April, I only
                  had about 3-4 days after my end-sems to report for my
                  internship. But as they say, “All’s well that ends well.”<br /><br />

                  <img
                    src="img/image1.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: right"
                  />
                  Once in Singapore, the first thing I couldn’t help but notice
                  was the amazingly reliable and efficient public transportation
                  system. MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) would go on to be an integral
                  part of my stay at Singapore. The astounding architecture of
                  the buildings at NTU, the facilities in laboratories, and most
                  importantly, the work ethic. As reluctant as I am to accept
                  this, I might have been ‘star-struck.’ The experience at the
                  university was slightly mundane at first. It was necessary to
                  complete a week-long safety training before diving into the
                  project work, but as time passed, the project went on to
                  become more and more intriguing. From the literature survey to
                  weekly meetings, the initial abundance of theoretical
                  knowledge about the topic seemed overwhelming. Although, this
                  abundance was soon replaced by an intricate lab experience.
                  Soon I got hold of the rhythm, and the project started moving
                  forward smoothly. Although initially I only used to perform
                  specific experiments instructed by my ‘buddy’ (lab mentor),
                  later I also conducted an independent study using UV
                  spectroscopy to study the kinetics of our reaction. As
                  surprising as it might get, this study was “good enough” to be
                  included in a manuscript that my ‘buddy’ would author. This
                  experience was enhanced by the fact that in NTU, you have to
                  perform your own experiments, be it a small chemical reaction
                  or a complicated procedure involving liquid N2. Usually, the
                  graduate students and post-docs go through training to operate
                  most of the machines and then eventually perform their own
                  experiments autonomously without the help of anyone. My group
                  members were warm enough to allow me to accompany them for
                  their experiments, which significantly boosted my learning
                  experience.<br /><br />
                  <img
                    src="img/image3.jpg"
                    class="blog-img"
                    style="float: left"
                  />
                  In Singapore, the food was not a problem as there were
                  numerous North Indian and South Indian choices available.
                  Surprisingly, I found the food to be better than that served
                  in our mess (taste-wise). I don’t know if this was the sheer
                  incompetence of my taste buds or a somewhat intentional sneer
                  on the plight of our mess food 🤐. Thanks to MRT and the
                  astonishing work ethic, I could go on to explore various parts
                  of the city(/country) on weekends such as the Universal
                  Studios, Marina Bay and the well-known Merlion. These weekend
                  trips also served an essential role since I had to fill up the
                  refrigerator with the stock of milk, bread, and fruits because
                  eventually, you might get bored of the dosas, fries and aloo
                  ki sabzi. Plus, you never know when you might have to skip
                  your dinner to stay in the lab. Looking back in retrospect,
                  whether it was the independence of doing experiments at 9 PM
                  or the burden of moving my lethargic body to stock up
                  groceries for the next week, the internship rewarded me with
                  some of the most memorable days of my undergraduate life. The
                  journey that started as a farrago of gloomy exasperations (if
                  you realised what wordplay I did here ping me for a treat 😉)
                  ended exuberantly with beautiful memories, amazing
                  experiences, friends I can never forget and most importantly,
                  transcended me into a more confident version of myself. No
                  doubt I was slightly dejected to join IITK back.
