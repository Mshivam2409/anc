                    Hi! My name is Siddhanta Mhambrey and this is my internship story!
                  <br>
                </p>

                    I was thrilled when this opportunity came up for me to write this article and share my internship story. I’ve always wanted to share my story for various reasons including and not limited to; the unconventional path that it took, my love to offer advice (even though I may unabashedly not follow it myself), a tiny bit (read: huge amounts) of narcissism on my end and for the simple reason that truly if I ended up doing something then you most definitely can (such self-worth, much wow!). In retrospect, my whole journey through this internship is vivid, as all things tend to be, and hence available for my scrutiny. This article is nothing but a result of that scrutiny; things I think I did well and where I could have done better.

                     <br/><br/>
                     The time leading up to the internship season can be very nerve-wracking and stressful for some and definitely was for me. My head would be clouded with a flurry of thoughts like “Do I even know what I want to do?”, “I’m from BSBE (research-oriented branch) and don’t have the greatest of CPI’s so should I be even trying for an internship?”, “All my friends in the department are applying for a research internship. Should I just do the same?” and numerous others which would bog me down to the extent that my day to day activities would get disrupted. Everyone has their ways of dealing with this and mine was to talk it out with my friends and family. It would range from us wingies gathering around and making jokes about how we have no future (although some of them so obviously did have one, delusional pricks) to me having intense conversations with my mom about my apprehensions regarding the internship. You may have a similar way of dealing with it or some other way. But what’s important is to have that someone(s) or something that’ll provide you with an escape when things get too heavy throughout the time (right from the anxiety around preparation to the rejection of companies).
                     <br/><br/>
                     Preparation can never be overstated for something like internships. The more prepared you are the better. Using the summers productively is key and is also something I failed at miserably. Don’t make that mistake! Given the umpteen resources provided to us by GeeksForGeeks, Pariksha.com, SPO and Academic and Career Council (shameless plugin) it isn’t too difficult of a task to set aside a few hours each day and make use of these resources. I could share a few pointers that I saw my friends doing at that time which may help you out. Having an idea of the companies you are targeting, speaking with seniors who got an internship there previously and preparing accordingly is something that should be followed. Don’t apply for everything! If you are one of the rare few that have an idea of what he/she wants to do then apply only for those profiles. If you are one of us, who has no idea of what to do in life but at least knows what you don’t want to then make sure you avoid those profiles. Preparation should continue into the time when the tests begin. Unfortunately for me, it started then and I was taking each test as a practice for the next one. Although this helped with the nerves and so I would suggest for the adoption of a similar attitude of taking the test as a practice for the next one (but NOT the preparation pattern). After not having done well in the first few tests (which was very clearly due to my lack of preparation) the rest started to go good and I could feel an acceptance coming my way. At this point in the article, I really want to provide you with the happy ending that you want (that’s what she said), the perfect rags to riches story but it did not come my way. I got through three months without any acceptance. It was tough and so I made sure I had those people and things that I mentioned earlier around me at that time.
                     <br/><br/>
                     This is when I deviated from what most of my batchmates were doing and it is something I look back at kindly. I committed the “disdainful” act of searching for internships off-campus using contacts. I use the aforementioned adjective not because 2020 Siddhanta finds doing this disdainful but because that is the angle with which some parts of the campus in that environment of internship season and to some extent even 2018 Siddhanta viewed it. A thought that I had back then to help me with making that decision and also something that I think now when I look back is that I would much rather set up a good internship for myself, something that’ll help me build my profile rather than being given an intern that isn’t as contributing to my profile. Typically applying off campus requires going through a lot of sites hunting for a company that is suited to you. A simple google search would lead you to a number of websites that provide good internship opportunities. To name a few that I found very helpful were Internshala, LetsIntern and AngelList (this one is particularly good for startup internships). Efforts can always be made from LinkedIn as well. All correspondence takes place through mail and so make sure you always keep a check on it! Don’t shy away from asking people for help to set up an interview. As long as your capabilities are the ones that gets you the internship, setting up an interview should be done anyhow: beg, borrow or steal (Don’t take it literally please). And so with the help of a friend of mine (Y14, IIT Kanpur), I set up an interview for this internship (which links up with what I will mention later about networking during your internship). The interview was like any other. A few tips would be to know your resume through and through. I, and I’m sure a lot of you, resonate with the famous words, “Sometimes I’ll start a sentence and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way.” An interview, however, isn’t an ideal spot for the manifestation of said quote. So be prepared, be calm, take your time, have your thoughts in place and only then speak (even if all you’re saying is your thought process). Communication is a key factor that one must take care of. If you aren’t able to make the opposite person understand your achievements and experiences then you shouldn’t expect him/her to be satisfied with the answer. If this is something that you struggle with then previously practising an answer to every question would be a good way to prepare. 
                      <br/><br/>
                      Finally getting to the actual internship part of this internship article. My internship was in a start-up (The Gene Box) under a data analyst profile, located 10 minutes from my parental home (although Mumbai traffic could at times make it 45 minutes, fml) with two of my close friends working there. It was all that I could ask for. I’d suggest for everyone to at some point in their lives work in a start-up (the earlier, the better). Unlike the MnC’s that lie to you in your face about a flat structure and open-door policy, a start-up is bound to have such policies. With a lesser number of people working in quite a small office, it is practically impossible to not have such policies in order. Everyone in a start-up (even your boss) is new to the problems at hand and hence there is a lot of freedom provided for you to try your ideas. It is essential to use this freedom (which you will get irrespective of who you intern for) for your personal growth as well. I tried to make sure that all the technical skills I wanted to learn and put down in my resume were somehow being used in the work I was given in the office. Making the most of your internship to push forward your own personal development is something you must make sure you are doing. It may come with some added work during office hours but it’s worth it when you get to honestly (unlike some :P) right down points in your resume for placements. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    The Gene Box was and is a really fun place to work. Daily exercise sessions (where we would fake injury to escape it), gossip sessions over lunch, targeting one random employee to make fun of the whole day, writing “Hack CIA” on command prompt to….well hack CIA, going to the nearby Vada Pav stall for chai break, watching the heartbreaking semi-finals of India vs New Zealand together, going for drinks after work, making seniors treat you for lunch are just flashes that come to my head now that I look back and bring a genuine smile to my face. I can’t thank this internship and company enough for the role they played in my overall development as well. Socializing with people (read networking. Must do!), managing time more efficiently, teaching me the importance of documenting your work, having the confidence to say something in a conference room full of people are some (and trust me there are a lot!) of the personal skills that I have to thank The Gene Box for.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If I have to summarize in a line: make absolutely full use of your internship for your own growth and don’t forget to have a lot of fun along the way.

                      Best of luck for upcoming endeavours and don’t shy away from reaching out to me for any help!
