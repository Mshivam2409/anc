              <p class="blog-intro">
                I’m gonna cut right to the chase. I have divided this blog in 3 parts. The first part talks about my
                profile and background to put things in perspective, the second part talks about how I prepared for
                whatever companies I sat for, the last part talks about the selection process and interview of the
                primary company of interest (Gartner). You can read each section independently, depending on what you
                might be interested in reading.

              <p>
                <h4>Profile and background<br><br></h4>
                I am a Y17 student in Electrical Engineering and in my first year I was a part of team AUV where I was
                involved mainly in the software part of the robot. At the end of the first year, I did a summer
                internship in Android app development. Till this point, I was interested in a coding profile, but after
                this I realized that I have reached saturation in the coding field, and I’d rather learn something new
                and Excel (pun intended, you’ll understand later) in that.
                <br /><br />
                I switched teams and joined ERA in my 2nd year. I tried to learn more things related to machine learning
                (since this was the new fad, and I thought I’d rather just follow the crowd). I did Andrew Ng’s course
                on machine learning (yeah, cliché, I know) and took up a project on machine learning applied to images
                as well so that I can learn some things hands-on. Till this point, I was interested in robotics, so I
                applied to a number of robotics startups (in India AND abroad) for an internship role in path planning,
                computer vision or just robotics in general. Somewhere along the line (I can’t put my pulse on exactly
                where), I started losing interest in robotics and just wanted to try a role in data analysis (churning
                huge amounts of data and making sense of it). I made use of some LinkedIn connections and landed a
                summer internship at Deloitte Bangalore at the end of 2nd year.
                <br /><br />
                I am gonna take a detour here and talk about the importance of internships before 3rd year. I can’t
                emphasize enough how much this one internship changed my perspective towards my involvements in campus,
                towards my attitude and just how everything in life now looked. My work involved using R and Excel (now
                revisit the pun) to download data, analyze data and make a presentation explaining the model to the
                senior management. I grew in terms of the technical skills I had, the confidence to take up ANYTHING new
                thrown my way and my professional communication skills (communicating with so many people in the
                company). But more importantly, I knew that data science is something I want to do, something I can grow
                in, this corporate setting is something I like and this is the direction I should go ahead in. You can
                observe in this timeline, the first internship told me that coding is not for me and the second
                internship told me that data science IS for me. This is how previous internships mold your career and
                this is why I encourage everyone to have some internship experience.
                <br /><br />
                During this internship, I explored finance by doing some online courses and I realized that a cross
                between finance and data analysis is the perfect career path for me.
                <br /><br />
                Oh and this internship was only till June 2019, so I went on a grand US road trip (drove through ~28
                states) with my family in July 2019. Totally exhilarating experience!
                <br /><br />
                <h4>Preparation for companies<br><br></h4>
                If you skipped the previous section, I had interned at Deloitte Bangalore in data science and had
                finally decided that a cross between finance and data analysis is the perfect career path for me. As
                such, I only had algo trading, banks and data science companies in my mind when the internship season
                began, and I also tried to align my preparation accordingly.
                <br /><br />
                For data science, I already had working experience at Deloitte, so that worked A LOT in my favour. I
                only had to revise concepts learned during the internship, revise notes of MSO201 (if you can gather
                notes for this course from anyone, I don’t think anything else is needed to learn probability and
                statistics atleast from the internship season point of view) and I did the 50 challenging problems book
                for probability and statistics interview questions. For finance, there is not much preparation required.
                Knowing that we are engineering students, not a lot of finance knowledge is expected of us. Nonetheless,
                I decided to look up keywords on Investopedia and keep following the trail of suggested reading on the
                website. Just following this trail on Investopedia gives you a lot of brief knowledge about the world of
                finance.
                <br /><br />
                One thorn to the rose of data science is that the screening test almost always has a coding component.
                So I had to brush up my data structures and algorithms concepts (I barely got a B in the course, and I
                have no shame in admitting that I am NOT GOOD at it at all). I used InterviewBit to its full extent and
                practiced problems on it. I also practiced puzzles on the website. These puzzles are common questions in
                quant, data science and general interviews.
                <br /><br />
                I wasn’t planning to sit for any group discussion (GD) heavy companies (ITC, HUL) but I was planning for
                Nomura and it had a GD component in its selection process. I attended SPOs mock GD session for Nomura
                and found out some common topics for GDs in finance. I looked up all these topics on the internet and
                made notes on it so that I can enter the GD room with some context in mind to help me better guide the
                GD. As it turned out, I got my internship before I could even apply to Nomura.
                <br /><br />
                I had applied to Deutsche Bank (finance), Tower (algo trading), CapitalOne (data science, finance),
                Goldman Sachs (quant), Gartner (data science) and got shortlisted for the last three.
                <br /><br />
                <h4>Selection process and interview<br><br></h4>
                Gartner hosts a screening test first which has mental aptitude, machine learning, data science,
                probability and statistics and coding sections. I did well in all the non-coding sections. I got
                shortlisted for the interview.
                <br /><br />
                The night before the interview, I revised all the notes I had made for data science and probability and
                statistics. All of that preparation helped in the interview. The interview was divided in 3 parts. The
                first part was heavy on data science, the second part was heavy on product development and the last part
                was the HR round.
                <br /><br />
                The first round of data science was the best experience I have had. The interviewers had a look at my
                resume, saw my experience at Deloitte and asked me to explain a bit about the work. After that they gave
                me a case where data science had to be applied and asked me about my approach towards solving the case.
                In the process, they tested my data science and probability and statistics skills (deciding feature
                importance, when to use F1 score and when to use precision/recall). After this, they asked me an
                algorithms-related question which I unfortunately cannot recall right now. But it was fairly simple and
                I was able to answer it correctly. After this I was asked to wait for some time.
                <br /><br />
                The second round of product development was a new experience for me. I was not prepared for this round
                at all. I was asked a question which is apparently standard in product development roles. I was asked to
                think through the development of a specified product. I searched that same question after the interview
                and obviously there was no right answer but there are a lot of different ways to go about it. Interviews
                like this only want to find out how out-of-the-box your thinking process is. I think I did fairly well.
                After this I was asked to wait for some time.
                <br /><br />
                The last round was HR. There are some standard questions in HR which you should look up on the internet.
                Why choose our company? Why should we hire you? What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? Where
                do you see yourself in five years? Tell us about a time when you faced a difficult situation and how you
                managed it. Tell us about a time when you directed a group of people to achieve a common goal. These are
                questions you should think about BEFORE entering the interview, NOT DURING the interview. The questions
                in my interview were mostly directed towards finding out how my aspirations have shaped up until now.
                The answers were mostly candid and honest recollections of my life and my family. At the end of the
                interview I was a guesstimate question, which I did fairly as well.
                <br /><br />
                <h4>Concluding remark<br><br></h4>
                Look at this lockdown as a blessing in disguise (I was, until a few days ago, but things changed, let’s
                not go there) and do that ‘thing’ that you have been putting away for too long for any and every excuse
                that was coming to mind. Now is the time for you to make the productive use of your time to achieve
                something. For any doubts regarding general career or data science roles, feel free to ping me on
                Facebook Messenger.
